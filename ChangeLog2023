    Merge: fe1a067e 028de444

    Merge branch 'install' of https://github.com/flagarde/libdwarf-code into flagarde-install
    Testing pull request

    The branch updates and simplifies all the CMakeLists.txt files
    to use include(GNUInstallDirs) and take advantage of all it does.
    Works fine in all test environments (including VS).

     error: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Werror=pointer-to-int-cast]

    On 32bit systems casts like (Dwarf_Unsigned)

    to avoid failing in compilations.
    Four places.

    Would not fail if one avoids --enable-wall and the like.

    commit c71e435ac49df3f99eac4e0181b75efe4e19e397

    Added new fields to Dwarf_Debug for use...soon:
    de_ftype (one of the DW_FTYPE values)
    and de_processor (soon to be the object data
    saying which processor is named in the object file).

    Documenting new functions dwarf_get_section_info_by_index_a()
    and dwarf_get_section_info_by_name_a()
    which return additional section information to callers
    for all supported object types..

    commit d3596f02aca5bf1a9b151a7c80f5c9cf261508fb

    Coverityscan found 3 issues.

    Here, they were real could lead to a segv.
    the issue was the code has options oriented
    to testing (probably a mistake to put such in an example)
    and there was a dereference of a null pointer
    that could occur in a particular scenario. Fixed.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfexample/simplereader.c

    Here the (new, undocumented) option of leaving
    either of two pointer inputs (for return values) NUll to
    dwarf_get_section_info_by_name was
    not coded correctly.  Fixed.

    And now, for DW_OP_const_type checks the cu-relative

    happens only once .

    Merge: e9355ca7 583ece00

    Merge branch 'jeremy-rifkin-cmake-improvements'

    Adds cmake GNUInstallDirs for cross platform installs.
    Introduces a set of CMAKE_INSTALL_* variables
    which do not conflict with anything in the libdwarf project.
    A description in some detail is in the book
    Provessional CMake (I have no financial interest

    commit 667a6fa8aa7f194a93feae917807033f876fae91

    Simplifying. We now require both zlib and libzstd
    to be present for decompressing object sections.
    If one is missing it is the same as both missing
    and then we build libdwarf with no decompression
    capability.
    It's much simpler code this way.

    commit 45c4b785359b32ff20a9325e2776855ee9abfaa1

    Now meson can find and use zlib, libzstd even
    if they are in /usr/local/lib instead of system directories.
    Or in /opt/local/lib etc. No user action required.

    We no longer use any deprecated meson functions.
    The meson version required is still 0.53.

    commit b5c2aa54344f4a725ecb7e81cd7f92d68e3d48ba

    Now using project_build_root() and
    project_source_root() instead of the
    deprecated functions build_root() and
    source_root().

    Updated the required version to 0.56 as this
    is the version required to support the project*()
    commands we now use.

    Also added code to look in specific directories
    beyond the standard locations
    for zlib and libzstd (/opt/local/lib and /usr/local/lib)
    so the build can work in more environments.

    commit 37c0c26e48754ee69288d73f238d4f54ce957fdb

    Now checks if required functiosn exist and sets
    HAVE_UTF8 inconfig so dwarfdump built with meson
    and print UTF8 properly.
            modified:   meson.build

    Added options sanitize as in -Dsanitize=true
      so we can use -fsanitiz3
    and wall as in -Dwall=false
      so we can turn off warnings as errors.

    returned change the prefix of the output to $HOME
    if that is equivalent to what is the returned string.

    Added `dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3_b` which returns the subsequent PC and whether there are more rows, for easy iteration through all rows in an FDE. This is similar to what `dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_c` already does. (#188)

    This is the fix for vulnerability ossfuzz id ossfuzz62943,
    DW202310-001
    which  has been in the public repository for one day.
    Was failing to check, very early on, for
    an incomplete Mach-O universal object.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_machoread.c
    Here is the timeline of Apple Universal Binary handling
    in libdwarf:

    2023-09-20
    In github libdwarf-code discussion #185
    asks if libdwarf supports Mach-O universal objects,
    which We will abbreviate here as Apple Universal Objects (AUB).
    Each AUB may have a number of Mach-O executables inside.

    2023-09-21
    Initial commit in the readelfobj-code project of code
    reading AUB.

    2023-09-26
    Completed code handling AUB in readelfobj-code project..

    2023-09-27
    In the  libdwarf-code project we do a little
    code cleanup related to Mach-O object files.
    Added a new API function for
    AUB in libdwarf.h

    2023-09-29
    Initial commit in dwarfdump so dwarfdump can
    select what Mach-O object in an AUB to report on
    (defaults to object 0(zero)).

    2023-09-29
    Full AUB support is now public on github,

    commit f7c7e84e5a77915bb6570215887118d8e7759122

    We have reset memcpy()-like functions to
    use the prototype that libdwarf has long
    exported to callers (on request).
     void  copy_word(void *, const void *,unsigned long)

    The length in practice is small where our swap/no-swap
    functions are involved.

    There were some inconsistencies but freebsd 32bit
    with clang caught them all, so it should be ok
    everywhere.

    commit a19f51f629dc2d2f84d99926494422cc57e5c10f

    Now all the word_swap swap_bytes functions
    have the  length argument as size_t (there was
    some with unsigned long).
    No calls to these should have a length > 8
    (since swap makes no sense on non-integers).

    commit f6941ef1254d72c621fbe8d2f8c1abe9a60262db

    On FreeBSD 13.2 clang 14 -fsanitize catches certain errors before
    adding to pointers or before having unsigned
    add/subtract wrap around (whereas before
    such were ignored and we could test afterwards
    for invalid results).
    So we check before doing the arithmetic now
    and return error if appropriate.

    Clearer now that continuing to use

    and dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_b()
    versions for frame register access is
    ok. Lets one use current or earlier
    libdwarf shared objects.
    the new _c() versions simply return
    one argument as the correct type (Dwarf_Signed).

    commit b052c88512369771ff946f824d83064656673695

    Added new functions
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_c()
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_c()
    which correctly return a Dwarf_Signed
    value for the dw_offset argument.

    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_b()
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_b()
    remain unchanged. These return a Dwarf_Unsigned
    dw_offset value, which callers must
    cast to Dwarf_Signed for correct use
    on DWARF frame information,
    as has been true since the first libdwarf.

    commit 8c3812dad14d7a1e9e8b49fb56d3d96ffd2fdc08

    Having realized some options used in configure were
    suppressing some very valuable warnings,  discovered
    that the following were only in configure.ac (not
    cmake or meson) and verified each suppresses simple
    warnings such as 'unused local variable'.
    Removed the following warnings:
     -Wnull-dereference causes bogus warnings.
     -Wbad-function-cast removes useful warnings
     -Wnostringop-overread  removes useful warnings
     -Wbad-function-cast  removes useful warnings

    Minor change to a comment.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_base_types.h

    Now correctly uses the DWARF5 includes array
    in the line table header to get the compilation
    directory (when required) to produce the
    fullest file path possible.
    It nearly always gave the right answer, but
    in the special case where  a file index of N
    in the table had a directory index of 0
    the full path came out wrong (duplicate directory
    names).

            modified:   scripts/buildandreleasetest.sh

    Fixed the check for errors on running regression tests:
    some time ago the final count emitted
    by libdwarf-regressiontests was changed from
    FAIL 0
    to
    FAIL     count: 0
    and run-all-tests.sh was not adjusted to match.

    Now we check that the number of files
    that
      cmake install
    installs matches the number
    we know is right. TEST F does this check.

    commit 831b634c19898cf99ca240cd26b83dc3be6d96b2

    cmake only:
    If (for some reason) one wanted to install libdwarfp
    and dwarfgen ...the install would not be complete
    if using -DBUILD_DWARFGEN:BOOL=YES
    or -DBUILD_DWARFGEN=YES

    Various small mistakes lead to an incomplete install.
    No-one should be using -DBUILD_DWARFGEN:BOOL=YES
    one thinks, but it is unfortunate this option's
    install was done incorrectly till now.

    commit f213254afe916b4c7e51fdd88aec4e062d97b470

    cmake install
    was not installing dwarf.h.
    The bug was introduced in 2021 when
    the source files were moved around to the
    current layout and the base CMakeLists.txt
    install lines were copied to the libdwarf dir.

    This deletes 2 useless lines and adds a specific
    line to get dwarf.h installed.

    commit 277e4f718e0061a068a74287291a4d8e8d18e94a

    Non-shared builds and shared-lib builds
    result in libdwarf.so (or .dll) having
    only the intended API functions visible to callers.
    Modified to match up with the altered #defines
    near the start of libdwarf.h .

    builds.

2023-06-18:  David Anderson
    commit c3b42421059bffbdecdb7250c8e58cb90f20c4b2

    Revising the list of #defines allows
    building of correct shared library libdwarf
    in all environments while
    allowing non-shared (static library)
    builds with cmake and meson.
    For linux static library builds
    can be done.
    The #defines are slightly easier to
    understand with this revision.

    Updates reflecting a new meson option
    --default-library
    and the ability to do correct
    shared library builds (meaning
    library-internal functions are invisible
    to callers) with all three
    build systems.

    Fixing DW202306-009 ossfuzz id: 59775

    A carefully fuzzed object could read one
    byte past the end of a frame section
    If the last thing in a frame section
    is DW_OP_GNU_encoded_addr (data is
    supposed to follow such). Corrupt Dwarf.
    Now we check and return an error.
    This vulnerability involved DW_OP_GNU_encoded_addr.

    commit d9cd2592337d99f44dd6ccb6f4cdee6c3a7bf822

    Now uses safe arithmetic where it matters.

    Adds
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_c()
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_c()
    as alternatives to
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_b()
    Cdwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_b()

    The difference is the newer ones have a Signed
    offset, which properly matches the text of
    the DWARF standard(s).
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.c

    Added a new file ru_soffset to support new functions
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_c()
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_c()
    which provide a signed offset for certain
    operations (as stated above).

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.h
    Adds two new functions and two new structs
    to support the new signed offset while
    keeping the versions that already existed.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h

    In other words there new functions and structs,
    but the previously existing ones are still supported.

    commit 8ef9c8fb613e59f534e789e91a73088eaa5b8a5a

    Vulnerability DW202305-010 ossfuzz id: 59478
    Fuzzing provoked one of four error cases that
    could leak locally allocated memory from
    _dwarf_exec_frame_instructor()
    (called by dwarf_expand_frame_instructions).
    Called enough times with fuzzed data could result
    in filling memory leading to the library being unable
    to work for the caller and instead just returning errors.

    This bug has been present in the code for many years.

    we failed to call _dwarf_free_static_errlist()

    Document  DW202305-006 ossfuzz id: 56472
    The test code as written here
    gets an error from valgrind for calling libdwarf
    with an uninitialized pointer.  The fix is to
    initialize the Dwarf_Die instance by adding  = 0;
    This was not a libdwarf bug (the original
    fix actually fixed a libdwarf bug, and this
    valgrind issue pointed out the need for the test case fix..

    DW202305-005 ossfuzz id: 56462
    To avoid leaks the libdwarf calling program
    MUST call dwarf_finish(). The code here
    was failing to do that in a number of
    error situations.
    Now it just returns from functions on error
    and lets main() call dwarf_finish(),
    a call that has always been in main().

    commit 4017ab8b92195641e6876b388cebe2d3307634f5

    This is the final code change for
    release libdwarf-0.7.0

    When the experimental two-level line table
    support was written one test for '> sectionend'
    was wrong, it needs to be '>= sectionend'.
    Written in 2021.
    In some other cases '>' is ok.

    are more understandable.

    commit 685372749ce431fd5ba3b2fddfa7d0306b3c8a7f

    Now the list of section names to ignore
    is handled with binary search, so
    cutting search time approximately in half.

    commit dd6093f5efbd57dbd2e8e2441093067e4313d9e2

    Now all the builds use the new source file,
    and the self tests all test the revised function.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_elf_load_headers.c
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_init_finish.c

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_opaque.h

    Factored out _dwarf_startswith and
    _dwarf_ignorethissection
    for simpler testing and smaller code.
    Shortly  performance will be improved too,
    since the refactoring makes that easy..

    commit 6c667ab643f4a78d153b58bc3690047d9fca2f09

    This fixes a problem due to the way one user
    creates group sections for .text as an aid to
    LTO (link time optimization), which pointlessly
    cause libdwarf to issue an error.
    Pointless because libdwarf pays no attention to
    the sections causing an error, so we should ignore
    them in section groups too.

    In read_gs_section_group() use _dwarf_ignorethissection
    to avoid putting section group entries with the unwanted
    names in any group.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_elf_load_headers.c

    Changing _dwarf_ignorethissection() to use
    startswith() instead of strcmp() in looking for
    text etc that libdwarf is not interested in.

    commit da0d1efbeddcff23c25704bd9672e98314928b19

    Some lines printing DWARF_CHECK appeared when
    doing printing. Now they only appear when doing'checking.
    It has to do with line (table) details details
    suceeding or (in 3 test objects) failing.
    Now we don't print the DWARF_CHECK
    if printing.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_line.c

    A fix to oss fuzz 57711.
    A problem present for many years.
    A crash due to a negative value
    in a line table Dwarf_Signed API.
    The stack trace shown was pretty crazy (a mess).
    Many places were having trouble checking bounds
    due to the historic choice of Dwarf_Signed
    in the API interfaces but Dwarf_Unsigned internally
    (as Dwarf_Unsigned is really the only sensible choice).
    So now we explicitly check for value < 0
    (where that makes sense) so even with signed values
    we can do other checks without worrying about
    negative values.

    While that may not have changed the output

    ossfuzz 57527.
    A .debug_line section truncated to just the right point
    (in a certain 12 byte area)
    in a line table header causes an memory reference outside
    any correct data.
    This has been true for many years.
    Now we check before looking at memory.
    In addition a few _dwarf_error() now use _dwarf_error_string()
    so some possibly-useful information can be reported
    by library callers.
    Also deleted 4 lines of dead code (was repeating
    a test done a few lines above).
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h

    commit 61d50244ca20877638ae5ca1c453f5066198c6d4

    The compiler used in workflows noticed an unused
    argument that is not noticed in local builds.
    This removes that unused argument
    in _dwarf_read_str_offsets_header().

    Fixes DW202303-045.  We were not checking

    The restriction that the regex search pattern
    may only include the ASCII subset of utf-8
    is now enforced and ERRORs result if it is
    violated.

    commit 3269f43d2a044bfcce71d30ce214a305473d1ea3

    Fixes DW202303-044

    With that lone backslash  in --search-regex=\\
    (or any pattern ending in backslash)
    The regex compiler incremented p by one and
    then dereferenced and stored the
    resulting value. But if the dereference
    gave 0 (the NULL byte) this resulted
    in unpredictable, but bad, effects
    since unknown bytes after the pattern string
    would then be referenced as part of the pattern.
    Now we notice the improper NUL and issue an error.

    commit 0c92ef5b66c5bbcacae03fbf355b12713151c098

    Fixes oss fuzz 57107. The infinite loop
    was caused by letting internal function
    _dwarf_find_CU_Context_given_sig()
    unconditionally do too much in the middle
    of setting up a CU_Context (by letting
    it start more CU_contexts().
    The implicit infinite loop has been there
    a few years, depending on the correctness
    of object files DWARF4/DWARF5 being read.

    Calls new internal _dwarf_internal_global_formref_b()
    (which is also called by dwarf_global_formref_b()
    with its specific new argument at zero)
    So for internal-library-use we can make
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c

    Introduced
    a new function _dwarf_internal_find_die_given_sig8()
    with a new argument and now API
    function dwarf_find_die_given_sig8() just calls
    the new function with a specific value (0)
    of the new argument for the general case.

    Added a #if 0 dump_bytes() local function
    for debugging of Sig8 values.
    Added a new argument to
    _dwarf_find_CU_Context_given_sig() so it can
    properly decide whether it should
    create new CU_Contexts or not.

    commit 1ff4365bd64a4e4f9ab717b3f62589c2ba6637a5
    ossfuzz id 56540.
    ossfuzz id 56487.
    ossfuzz id 56480.
    ossfuzz id 56497.
    These fixes are to the tests, not the library.
    Several had code that was going to crash
    due to mistakes in the test code itself.

    Removed all instances of free(errp)
    where errp is
       Dwarf_Error *errp
    as that is never necessary or appropriate.
    Any leftover allocations made in libdwarf
    and not 'dwarf_dealloc*' or documented
    as user-must-free data returned via pointers
    to the caller are
    automatically freed by dwarf_finish()
    unless there are libdwarf bugs.

    commit e564c9350c104f16eb2223d7b29082e3deb5d2fb

    Added many checks for valid pointers and offsets.
    Corrected logic which was just wrong.
    Now ossfuzz 56676 passes (DW202303-006).
    Also fixes oss fuzz 56456.
    These problems existed since this source was
    written in 2014.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_gdbindex.c
    Added two small comments.

    index is higher than exists in an array.

    commit 0343c63bd04d387924974e6da60d8471fdf945a9

    This is a significant revision of dwarf_str_offsets.[ch]
    with consequences in several places.
    ossfuzz id 56478.
    ossfuzz id 56489.
    ossfuzz id 56476.

    The old code was hard to follow. This
    is much easier to understand.

    Still has debugging-related #if 0 in it, those will be removed in
    the next commit.

2023-03-07:  David Anderson
    commit 86671059c1c240ae56433fa94993dcd28df2ae7d

    Corrected several things to get correct processing.
    Tests for appropriate values from READ_AREA_LENGTH_CK
    were nowhere exactly correct, so all have been updated
    (see last two commits).
    Also fix 56453.
    This should finally fix oss fuzz  56636.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugaddr.c

    an improper DW_FORM value did not return an error
    and compounded problems by continuing on,
    leading to a memory leak.

    commit 217037be0da853b2dfb08e52a2c8c3a480a0ae47

    Removed the API functions
    dwarf_dnames_abbrev_by_code()
        (which is slow, not needed
        Use either dwarf_dnames_name() or
        dwarf_dnames_abbrevtable() instead, depending
        on what you want to accomplish.)

    And
    dwarf_dnames_abbrev_form_by_index()
        (which never worked
        and was never tested except just before removing
        this function).

    commit a9a8924d775c0389220a0fce7a762f4752fd974c

    Everywhere we dealloc (drop)
    a Dwarf_Error ensure we have a valid
    Dwarf_Error* to dereference for the
    dealloc.
    These situations arise when the calling
    program passes NULL as the Dwarf_Error*
    to a libdwarf function, which normally
    only happens in toy or small calling
    programs.

    commit 7368a1062271e08e7df0f188d8b02c9991a0d03a

    This creates a useful libdwarf.pc with install.

    It also creates a useless extra libdwarf.pc
    which is not at all useful. Unsure why.
    You will get better results using meson instead
    in most cases.

    commit 4f6376d8f4d57497e4083405d94f00651576b51a

    _dwarf_memcpy_swap_bytes is now simpler and accomodates
    all words 8 bytes or less long by swapping bytes.
      modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_memcpy_swap.c

    Now uses memcpy to write part of
    the line table header, not WRITE_UNALIGNED
    as WRITE_UNALIGNED is intended for integers
    requiring byte-swapping when the target object
    and the runnning libdwarfp do not have the
    same endianness. the write changed is a set of
    bytes, not an integer at all.

    commit 1bffee59eb8de582fe360601a0a7d485a45fe066

    Twenty functions named
      dwarf_<something>
    were really internal-only functions. Not in the API.
    A few named decades ago, some created more recently.
    Now all such have a leading single underbar, so named
    _dwarf_<something> as a clear indication they
    are not part of the API.
    These became apparent comparing the API (libdwarf.h)
    to functions reported by coverage analysis (gcov/lcov).
