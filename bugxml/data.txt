  when added to a valid pointer
  (depending on how the runtime memory is laid out) 
  and thereafter a dereference results in a 
  segmentation violation).

description:  7/7. A heap overflow in

  A  pointer for being in bounds (in a few places in this

  _dwarf_get_loclist_header_start() is not cautious about values
  in the header being absurdly large.
  Unclear as yet if this is the problem
  but it is a potential problem (fixed for next release).
  <pre>
  Address Sanitizer in gcc reproduces the report.
  In _dwarf_read_loc_section() the simple calculation of
  loc_section_end was wrong, so end-of section was
  incorrect for the local reads.
  With that fixed we get DW_DLE_READ_LITTLEENDIAN_ERROR when
  libdwarf attempts to read off end of section.

 The bad pointer dereference is due to libdwarf

 In addtion
 The code was not noticing that it could dereference
 a pointer that pointed out of bounds in the end-sibling-list
 loop.

vulnerability: A specially crafted DWARF section
 results in a duplicate free() in libdwarf and
 the calling application will crash. 
product:  libdwarf
description:
 In file dwarf_elf_access.c:1071
 <pre>
 WRITE_UNALIGNED(dbg,target_section + offset,
     &outval,sizeof(outval),reloc_size);
 </pre>
 A crafted ELF file may lead to a large offset value, which
 bigger than the size of target_section heap chunk, then this
 WRITE_UNALIGNED() function will write the value of &outval
 out of the heap chunk.
 offset is a 64bit unsigned int value, so this is more than
 a heap overflow bug, but also a Out-of-Bound write bug.
 So WRITE_UNALIGNED() need more strictly checking to prevent
 this.
