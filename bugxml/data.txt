vulnerability: Incorrect section bound check
product: libdwarf
description:  A fuzzed line table in the non-standard

  whereas it has to be v >= sectionend as end pointers
  are always one-past the end of the area.
  This was incorrect since the experimental table support

product: libdwarf
description:  A fuzzed line table in the non-standard

  The failure was due to oss-fuzz limiting malloc to 3GB.

description:  Crash in libdwarf on dwarf_srcfiles() call.
  A dereference off a null pointer due to corrupt

  Dwarf_Unsigned work as intended.

vulnerability: Denial of Service with fuzzed object.
product: libdwarf
description: The fuzzed testcase has at least four major
  errors which libdwarf did not catch, leading
  to unpredictable library behavior, possibly
  including crashing the calling program.
  Things not noticed before the fix (and now resulting
  in error being reported):
  A) The object has just 2 sections, 
  too few to be real.  at least 3 sections are needed
  to contain DWARF information of any kind.
  B) Section zero has non-zero contents, in violation
  of the Elf object specification.
  C) The header says section strings are in section
  zero (a violation of the Elf specification).
  D) Section 1 masquerades as .note.gnu.debug-id
  and the description size is gigantic (as is
  the section, which fits the description field
  length).

vulnerability: dwarfdump crashes if the nest of C scopes is too deep
product: dwarfdump
description: An object file where the DIEs depth of
  nesting exceeds the limit of 800 levels
  due to corruption or a compiler bug 
  can result in exhausting the die stack array and
  writing past its end.
  A segmentation fault is possible.
  The code at the point of error was not adjusting
  the array index properly
  so an invalid dereference could occur.
  Now the test code is correct and the array overflow
  is detected resulting in a normal error return.
  Additional places where this could occur were
  identified and the proper test added.
  <pre>
  Unable to enter in bugzilla.redhat.com
  so CVE can be completed by Fedora (as CNA)

vulnerability: A carefully corrupted line table can crash calling app
product: libdwarf
description: A carefully crafted object with an
  invalid line table could cause libdwarf
  to dereference a pointer reading a single byte outside of
  the intended .debug_line section and potentially
  outside of memory visible to the library.  
  A segmentation fault is possible.
  The code testing for the error was coded incorrectly
  so an invalid dereference could occur.
  Now the test code is correct and the error
  is detected resulting in a normal error return.
  <pre>
  This should be visible after redhat makes it public.

  _dwarf_get_loclist_header_start() is not cautious about values
  in the header being absurdly large.
  Unclear as yet if this is the problem
  but it is a potential problem (fixed for next release).
  <pre>
  Address Sanitizer in gcc reproduces the report.
  In _dwarf_read_loc_section() the simple calculation of
  loc_section_end was wrong, so end-of section was
  incorrect for the local reads.
  With that fixed we get DW_DLE_READ_LITTLEENDIAN_ERROR when
  libdwarf attempts to read off end of section.

 <pre>
 WRITE_UNALIGNED(dbg,target_section + offset,

 </pre>
 A crafted ELF file may lead to a large offset value, which
 bigger than the size of target_section heap chunk, then this
 WRITE_UNALIGNED() function will write the value of &outval
 out of the heap chunk.
 offset is a 64bit unsigned int value, so this is more than
 a heap overflow bug, but also a Out-of-Bound write bug.
 So WRITE_UNALIGNED() need more strictly checking to prevent
 this.

vulnerability:  Out-of-bounds read in dwarf_leb.c
product: libdwarf
description: libdwarf 20151114 and earlier allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer 
  dereference and crash) via a debug_abbrev
