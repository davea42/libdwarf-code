2020-11-25:   David Anderson 
    * Makefile.am: Now creates DWARF_BIGENDIAN env var for the tests
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
    * runtests.sh: Now skips the test (of crc32) that will always fail
      on a bigendian build.
2020-10-27:   David Anderson 
    * simplereader.c: changed a few lines
      to have shorter line lengths. No logic change. 
2020-10-21:   David Anderson 
    * dwdebuglink.c,findfuncbypc.c,frame1.c: Cleaning
      up line formatting a little. 
2020-10-19:   David Anderson 
    * Makefile.am: adding dummyexecutable.debug 
      and debuglink2.base so 'make check' can work.
2020-10-19:   David Anderson 
    * frame1.c,simplereader.c: Copyright lines reformatted
      to a shorter line to match libdwarf/dwarfdump
      formatting.  No change in copyright terms.
2020-10-11:   David Anderson 
    * debuglink.base, debuglink2.base: Improved debuglink
      formatting now in the make check baselines.
2020-10-11:   David Anderson 
    * Makefile.am: Added simplecrc.c
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated
2020-10-11:   David Anderson 
    * debuglink.base, debuglink2.base: New baselines
      with a small formatting correction.
    * dwdebuglink.c: Changes to correctly support dSYM
      and GNU debuglink and clarify the printed output.
    * simplecrc.c: A demonstration of using the debuglink
      crc.
2020-10-04:   David Anderson 
	* dwdebuglink.c: now works as intended.
	* runtests.sh Added a second test of debuglink
    * debuglink.base,debuglink2.base: Baseline output
      for dwdebuglink. Pathnames have source and
      build directory in the output replaced with strings
      ...src... or ...bld... so make check should
      work anywhere.
2020-10-03:   David Anderson 
    * Makefile.am: Added a recent shell script to the files
      brought into a release.
    * Makefile.in: Ubuntu 20.04 first autoreconf and
      the Makefile.am created small changes.
    * COPYING: Corrected the references to the BSD copyright
      to use "two-clause BSD license".
2020-10-02:   David Anderson 
    * dwdebuglink.c,debuglink.base: Removed debug print lines.
2020-10-02:   David Anderson 
    * dummyexecutable: For testing in make check.
    * dummyexecutable.debug: For testing in make check.
    * dwdebuglink.c:  Now checks paths a allows adding
      debuglink global paths.
    * runtests.sh : now has testoutput strip out blddir
      and srcdir so no reliance on anyone's home directory name.
    * buildingdummy.sh: Not usable as general regression test
      but tests a number of things the regression test does
      not (yet) and shows how a .debug is built.
2020-10-01:   David Anderson 
    * dwdebuglink.c: Refined the #includes so they worked
      with cmake.
2020-09-30:   David Anderson 
    * Renamed getdebuglink.c to dwdebuglink.c
      and the example executable is now dwdebuglink.
    * Makefile.am,CMakeLists.txt: reference new name.
    * Makefile.in: regenerated.
2020-09-30:   David Anderson 
    * findfuncbypc.c: Removed a mistaken version
      of include string.h
    * getdebuglink.c: Now finds debuglink objects
      and if one is truly a separate debug it
      reports that.
2020-09-29:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Now follows paths and compares
      buildid of the executable vs the debug object.
2020-09-27:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Removed trailing whitespace, improved
      the new messages in previous commit (greater
      clarity in the reference).
    * findfuncbypc.c,simplereader.c: Removed trailing 
      whitespace.
2020-09-27:   David Anderson 
    * getdebuglink.c: Now looks to see if target files exist
      and reports which files were found.
2020-09-25:   David Anderson 
    * debuglink.base: New baseline test output
      reflecting corrected debuglink in libdwarf.
2020-09-18:   David Anderson 
    * CMakeLists.txt: Add getdebuglink to the
      examples built (source getdebuglink.c added
      November 2019).
2020-03-14:   David Anderson 
    * findfuncbypc.c: do not call dwarf_dealloc on a 
      name that should not be dealloc'd (it is a static
      string from a .debug section ).
    * simplereader.c (resetsrcfiles): Only do dealloc
      calls on non-null pointers. 
2020-01-16:   David Anderson 
    * simplereader.c: Remove trailing whitespace (1 place).
