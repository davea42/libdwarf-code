  Renamed getdebuglink to dwdebuglink and added the ability
  fo find the debuglink target properly.

  Added getdebuglink.c to show how to use libdwarf to find a GNU alternate
  DWARF file.
  Add dummyexample.c as a trivial C test case, compiled into 
  the file dummyexample.  Compiled as
  cc -g dummyexample.c -o dummyexample
  This dummyexample (the executable) is a static, unchanging, file
  that getdebuglink can use in runtests.sh to verify getdebuglink
  works.

  simplereader.c: Added the --dumpallnames option so one can
  get all the strings from debug_info,_types into a file.
  A simple way to enable further examination of the strings.

  Roni Simonian noticed a call to  print_die_data(dbg,cur_die,in_level);
  was missing so not all DIEs would print.  Good Catch!

  Created a sample libdwarf consumer. Using BSD license so
  anyone can use it.  And a trivial Makefile.
