The following binary test cases are included in the dwarfdump
distribution to provide an unchanging means of verifying that
dwarfdump basically works.  November 5, 2019.

 Each .base is  the inital 500 lines produced by dwarfdump
 as a baseline to check against the latest compiled dwarfdump
 output.


testobjLE32PE.test.c was compiled to an executable on a
Windows 8.1 system with MinGW using a gcc compiler (called
just test.c at the time of the compilation).

testuriLE64ELf is a compilation of dwarfdump/uri.c and is
a plain .o, a relocatable (renamed .obj to avoid a reader
confusing this with build-time .o objects).

test-mach-o-32 is a little-endian compilation to an executable
of dwarfexample/simplereader.c on a 32bit Apple system using
Apple compilers.  The DWARF is in the .dSYM as is normal
for Apple and the executable is not present here: There is
no executable code here.  Notice the __TEXT and __DATA and
__PAGEZERO sections are empty (zero length).

The readelfobj project on sourceforge.net
can build executables for all three object
formats: readelfobj readobjpe readobjmacho
which will show the  object file headers.
