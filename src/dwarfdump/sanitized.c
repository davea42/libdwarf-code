/*  This does a uri-style conversion of control characters.
    So  SOH prints as %01 for example.
    Which stops corrupted or crafted strings from
    doing things to the terminal the string is routed to.

    We do not translate an input % to %% (as in real uri)
    as that would be a bit confusing for most readers.

    The conversion makes it possble to print UTF-8 strings
    reproducibly, sort of (not showing the
    real glyph!).

    Only call this in a printf or sprintf, and
    only call it once in any single printf/sprintf.
    Othewise you will get bogus results and confusion. */

appear to be questionable too.
Not in iso-8859-1 nor in html character entities list.

We translate all strings with a % to do sanitizing and
we change a literal ASCII '%' char to %27 so readers
know any % is a sanitized char. We could double up
a % into %% on output, but switching to %27 is simpler
and for readers and prevents ambiguity.

Since we do not handle utf-8 properly nor detect it
we turn all non-ASCII to %xx below.
