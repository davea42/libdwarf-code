2019-11-07 David Anderson
    * Makefile.am: Now set env vars so make check can
      get the compiler options.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
    * makename.c,makename_test.c: Refine the ifdef around the pragma
      so it only appears with windows and when
      the compile is not using gcc or clang to compile.
    * runtests.sh: New the new env var to get the configure time
      compiler options into the tests compilations.
2019-11-05 David Anderson
    * README.testcases: Documentation of the three binary
      testcases in the dwarfdump source directory.
    * testobjLE32PE.test.c: Original source for the
      testobjLE32PE.exe testcase. Not compiled here, just
      present as documentation.
    * Makefile.am: Name README.testcases and testobjLE32PE.test.c 
      so the get into releases.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
2019-11-05 David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h : new version string.
2019-11-04 David Anderson
    * Makefile.am: Fixed a trailing blank after a backslash.
2019-10-28 David Anderson
    * esb.c: Fixed a VSNPRINTF ifdef so it no longer
      uses ifdef to separate parts of a va-arg.
      Fixes a compiler warning.
    * runtests.sh: Instead of assuming esb.o present
      put $srcdir/esb.c in the test script.
2019-10-24 David Anderson
    * esb.h: Removed the bogus and unnecessary test
      of _MIPS_SZLONG. Just go with long long.
2019-10-22 David Anderson
    * common.c: Now -V prints both the date/time string
      and the PACKAGE_VERSION string from the top level
      configure.ac/CMakeLists.txt.
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated.
    * tag_attr.c: The #include ordering was a bit wrong
      as it checkded HAVE_UNISTD_H before config.h was
      included (from globals.h). Fixed.
    * getopttest.c: Added #include of config.h so
      the #ifdef around standard headers compiles.
    * print_reloc_decls.h,print_reloc_test.c,testesb.c: With 
      full warnings this needed ifdefs to the simple
      testcode will build. And removal of unused
      variables.
2019-10-21 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c,dwgetopt.c,esb.c,esb.h,getopttest.c,
       globals.h,makename.c,makename_test.c: Be much more
       thorough in using config.h to check for headers before
       including them.
2019-10-18 David Anderson
     * runtests.sh: Improving some message test so context makes sense.
2019-10-17 David Anderson
     * Makefile.am: A couple test files got left out of
       the list of critical files, so doing dist
       and then testing the result would fail 'make check'
     * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
     * runtests.sh: Small tweaks so 'make check'
       from outside the source tree works now.
2019-10-16 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Now sets -I so the ctest results pass.
     * dwarfdump.c: Altered a spelling to make a distinction
       between various places that say 'could not open the file'.
     * globals.h: Now #include use "" not <> on dwarf.h and libdwarf.h
       so they match everything else in dwarfdump and libdwarf.
2019-10-14 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h : new version string.
2019-10-14 David Anderson
     * command_options.c: Revised the settings of
       glflags.gf_gnu_debuglink_flag.
     * dwarfdump.c: Now we only print debuglink etc
       on request via --print-gnu-debuglink.
       Now call the latest, best version of 
       dwarf_gnu_debuglink() handling both .gnu_debuglink
       and .note.gnu.build-id sections.
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * runtests.sh: Added mach-o sanity test case.
     * test-mach-o-32.base,testobjLE32PE.base,testuriLE64ELf.base:
       each is limited to 500 lines to keep the space in use
       with non-source a bit constrained.
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * addrmap.c: The include of addrmap.h was in the wrong
       line. Noved down 4 lines.
     * globals.h: Refined the setup as the requirement for
       _GNU_SOURCE to be set does not apply when
       we have no libelf at all.
     * helpertree.c: Removed pointless include of esb.h.
     * helpertree_test.c: Added include of <stdint.h>
       so we are guaranteed uintptr_t for TSEARCHASH.
     * macrocheck.c: Removed a pointless include of esb.h.
     * runtests.sh: Removed useless tests of the native
       getopt as we never use it. 
       Ensure we get cc or gcc if at least one
       of them exists.
       Use rm -f and name with and without trailing .exe
       for portability to Windows/Mingw.
       Now verifies that dwarfdump on a PE file and
       an Elf file worked correctly as a
       sanity check.
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * testobjPE.base -> testobjLE32PE.base
     * testobjPE.exe ->  testobjLE32PE.exe
     * testuriBE64ELf.base -> testuriLE64ELf.base
     * testuriBE64ELf.obj ->  testuriLE64ELf.obj
     * Makefile.am: Reflects the revised names.

2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * Makefile.am: New test data for make check (runtests.sh)
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h: new date string.
     * dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,dwarfdump/dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
       new date string.
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * runtests.sh: Now runs dwarfdump on an elf and a PE
       object to show things basically work.
     * testobjPE.base,testobjPE.exe:  New
     * testuriBE64ELf.base,testuriBE64ELf.obj  : New
2019-09-19 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Fix indents and remove trailing whitespace.
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h: version string update, regenerated
       these.
     * print_frames.c: Small clarifications of the logic.
2019-09-10 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Now --print-gnu-debuglink prints
       the  .note.gnu.build-id and .gnu_debuglink sections
       (does both if both exist).
2019-09-08 David Anderson
     * command_options.c: Added --print-gnu-debuglink and set
       gf_gnu_debuglink_flag as appropriate.
     * dwarfdump.1: Document --print-gnu-debuglink.
     * dwarfdump.c: Implement debuglink printing.
     * glflags.h: Added boolean gf_gnu_debuglink_flag.
     * globals.h: Added prototype of print_secname()
       and now it is shared across dwarfdump.
     * print_abbrevs.c,print_locs.c,print_strings.c: Deleted local 
       print_secname(), call
       the shared one instead.
     * print_die.c: Make this print_secname() the
       single shared version.
2019-09-03 David Anderson
     * esb.h, esb.c: Reformat copyright for shorter lines.
       No change in the text.
     * print_abbrevs.c: Fix indents and remove trailing
       whitespace.
2019-09-02 David Anderson
     * print_abbrevs.c: Improved .debug_abbrev error checking.
       Now uses dwarf_get_abbrev_entry_b() which ensures
       most (possibly all) corruptions can be detected.
     * print_die.c: Reformatted a long comment.
2019-08-29 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Minor corrections including printing
       DW_AT_GNU_odr_signature more sensibly.
       Corrected checks for signature consistency in
       CU vs the .debug_[tc]u_ index section.
       Some reformatting for consistency.
     * print_lines.c: Remove a blank line.
     * print_ranges.c: Remove some debugging-only code.
2019-06-04 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Removed inttypes.h include as nothing in it
       is referenced.
2019-05-29 David Anderson
     * makename-test.c: change DW_TSHASHTYPE char *
       to DW_TSHASHTYPE uintptr_t to match the rest
       DW_TSHASHTYPE.
2019-05-29 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated with latest version.
2019-05-26 David Anderson
     * addrmap.c, makename.c: Include stdint.h for tsearch.
     * checkutil.c: Delete include inttypes.h. Fix
       trailing whitespace, reformat comments for
       line length.
     * dwarf_tsearch.h: Make include idempotent with
       #ifndef DWARF_TSEARCH_H.
       DW_TSHASHTYPE is now uintptr_t.
       Turn double-blank-lines to a single blank line.
       Use DW_TSHASHTYPE.
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c:  Delete include inttypes.h. Fix
       trailing whitespace.  Define DW_PR_DUx  and use
       DW_PR_DUx so printf formats properly.
       Remove const from keyptr: it's really wrong as
       the user may actually free what it points to.
       Use DW_TSHASHTYPE.  Correctly arrange const
       in casts.
     * helpertree.c,macrocheck.c,print_die.c: Include 
       stdint.h for tsearch.
2019-05-24 David Anderson
     * checkutil.c: Change %lx to instead use "%" DW_PR_DUx
       so it adapts without compiler warnings.
2019-05-24 David Anderson
     * Makefile.am: Delete mention of config.h.in.cmake.
     * Makefile.in: Regenerate.
2019-05-20 David Anderson
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Add windows-only #define intended
       to suppress warnings from particular compilers.
2019-05-20 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: No longer generates a local-build-dir
       config.h
     * config.h.in.cmake: Deleted.
2019-05-20 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Added addrmap.h to the HEADERS list.
       Reflects new names for the options and adds the
       compiler warning options. 
     * config.h.in.cmake: Adding in the necessary HAVE_*
       option defaults.
     * dwarfdump.c: Adds part of the HAVE_CUSTOM_LIBELF
       and DW_FTYPE_CUSTOM_ELF
       support (for the one environment wanting that).
       Drops the accidental print of date/time with -O <file>
       option to dwarfdump.
     * esb.c: Adding a Windows-specific define for Windows
       builds.
     * globals.h: Adding a comment.
     * tag_attr.list, tag_attr_ext.list,tag_tree.list,
       tag_tree_ext.list: Adding blank lines judiciously
       makes the table easier for humans to read.
2019-05-14 David Anderson
     * command_options.c: Removed unneeded trailing ',' 
       in initializer as it caused a warning in compile.
2019-05-14 David Anderson
     * print_reloc_test.c: Without libelf (in which case
       dwarfdump is not interested in printing relocations)
       we now compile a main program returning 0 (success).
       With libelf we examine the relocation name tables
       as usual to exit with success or failure.
2019-05-07 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Now the code from configure.cmake
       is here. Previously there were two includes of
       configure.cmake, which was a mistake.
     * Makefile.am: Added the *_test.c so tar distributions
       can run 'make check'.
     * scripts/buildandreleasetest.sh: Now adds in cmake
       build of dwarfgen and dwarfexample and test
       so those are tested.
     * configure.cmake: Deleted. It's all in
       CMakeLists.txt now.
2019-05-05 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h, dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated with latest
       libdwarf version string.
2019-05-02 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h: Regenerated.
     * tag_common.h: 16-> 15. Deleted a duplicate extension 
       TAG->Attr combo recently added so need to regenerate.
2019-05-02 David Anderson
     * helpertree.c: Deleted trailing blank line.
     * tag_attr_ext.list: Added gcc common extension
       of DW_TAG_structure_type having a DW_AT_containing type.
     * tag_common.h: Incremented EXT_ATTR_TABLE_ROWS to 16
       for the change in tag_attr_ext.list.
     * dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_leb.c: Removed trailing whitespace on one line.
     * dwarf_object_detector.c,dwarf_pe_descriptor.h,
       dwarf_pe_read.c: Using the updated names
       of some Windows types, adding _dw at the end to avoid
       conflicts with Windows.
     * dwarf_tied.c: Removed blank last line of the file.
     * dwarf_tied_decls.h: Removed several blank lines
       at the end of the file.
     * dwarf_tied_test.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-05-01 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.1: A stray letter 'i' was
       in the --format-extensions wording.
2019-05-01 David Anderson
     * configure.cmake: deleted.
     * globals.h: Corrected typo in comment.
     * CMakeLists.txt: Now does its configure_file on its own.
2019-05-01 David Anderson
     * configure.cmake: Removed some lines, placing them in
       base directory configure.cmake.
2019-04-30 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Added the new files. Revised the
       testing area the tests can be run and pass.
2019-04-30 David Anderson
     * helpertree_test.c,makename_test.c,print_reloc_decls.h,
       print_reloc_test.c,section_bitmaps_test.c: New
       source which separates the internal-api test code
       from the code dwarfdump actually uses.
       Removing most need of -DSELFTEST.
     * helpertree.c,makename.c,print_reloc.c,section_bitmaps.c,
       section_bitmaps.h: Now with just the code needed for
       dwarfdump itself.
     * runtests.sh: Reflects the refactoring of the internal
       api test code.
2019-04-29 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h: Regenerated.
       Version date update.
     * dwarfdump_ta_ext_table.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:  Regenerated. 
     * tag_attr_ext.list. Added DW_TAG_class_type
       with common GNU extension DW_AT_containing_type
     * tag_common.h: Increased EXT_ATTR_TABLE_ROWS to 15.
2019-04-28 David Anderson
     * config.h.in.cmake, configure.cmake: Deleted all reference to
       INT32 and INT64 as no longer needed.
2019-04-26 David Anderson
     * config.h.in.cmake,configure.cmake: Now deals
       with DWARF_WITH_LIBELF and more for cmake.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-04-25 David Anderson
     * common.c,dwconf.c: Tiny changes to
       avoid compiler warnings.
     * print_die.c: Refactored to avoid annoying
       compiler warning about a fall-through.
2019-04-24 David Anderson
     * command_options.c: Remove trailing space, fold a long line
     * dwarfdump.c: If init failed the message listed
       the wrong function name.
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Prevent the -a option from requesting
       Elf section data printing (no section
       data was printed anyway as the request was
       incomplete).
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Add test for _MSC_VER for Windows MSVC.
     * print_die.c: Using uintptr_t to suppress a warning.
2019-04-22 David Anderson
     * checkutil.c: Now uses uintptr_t so we can avoid
       compile-time warnings about converting pointer to
       integer.
     * command_options.h: Ifdef a couple of static
       function prototypes so, when regex missing,
       we do not get warnings of undefined static functions.
     * dwarf_tsearchbal.c: Add ifdef-d stdint.h and
       inttypes.h so we can avoid some conversion warnings
       from printf calls.
     * dwarf_alloc.c:  Add ifdef-d stdint.h and
       inttypes.h so we can avoid some conversion warnings
       from printf calls.
2019-04-19 David Anderson
     * Apology. This enhances pubnames-like printing
       and uses non-libelf elf access as much as possible
       (even if libelf present). With --disable-libelf
       it allows all but printing Elf section headers
       and relocation records.  It's excessively large
       for one commit(mainly in libdwarf). Sorry.
     * command_options.c: Conditionalize the help message
       so the Elf section printing is not shown if
       --disable-libelf chosen at configure time.
     * dwarfdump.1: Mention that --disable-libelf removes
       certain elf section header printing options.
     * dwarfdump.c: Implements the elf reading changes.
     * print_strings.c: Fixed a printf to use sanitized()
       so we don't print non-ascii (we use uri form instead).
2019-03-08 David Anderson
     * print_pubnames.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2019-03-07 David Anderson
     * print_pubnames.c(print_all_pubnames_style_records): A
       struct esb_s was constructed and filled but then never
       destructed, leading to a memory leak. Eliminated it 
       entirely.
2019-03-04 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with latest date string
       and version.
     * dwarfdump.c: Corrected indent mistakes.
     * glflags.h: Removed blank line.
     * globals.h: Added print_all_pubnames_style_records() declaration
       so all the pubnames-like sections are printed by just one
       function.
     * print_die.c: Fixed indents. Removed trailing whitespace.
     * print_pubnames.c: Now has the print code for all the
       pubnames-like sections. The pubnames-like section
       names only print if there is some data.  We now
       also (for those sections) print the section CU-headers
       if dwarfdump -v.   Some error messages modified slightly
       to show the correct section name (as opposed to leaving it
       off). Now can do the coded checks instead of ignoring them.  
     * print_sections.c: Moved deal_with_name_offset_err() over
       to print_pubnames.c, where it is now a static function.
     * print_sections.h: Removed declarations of deal_with_name_offset_err()
       and print_pubname_style_entry() as those are now static functions
       in print_pubnames.c.
     * print_static_funcs.c, print_static_vars.c: Now only print 
       section name if there
       is content. Corrected a long-incorrect section name of this
       SGI-extension section you most likely have never seen.
       Deleted the old printing code, do it via call into
       print_pubnames.c.
     * print_types.c,print_weaknames.c: Now only prints 
       section name if there is content.
       Deleted the old printing code, do it via call into
       print_pubnames.c.

2019-02-24 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-table.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with latest date string
       and version.
2019-02-19 David Anderson
     * configure.cmake: Now defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
       so builds work as always.
     * dwarfdump.c,globals.h,print_reloc.c: Now uses
       DWARF_WITH_LIBELF to determine how to build
       with or without libelf.
2019-02-12 David Anderson
     * print_die.c: Delete _dwarf_memcpy_swap_bytes() as it
       is no longer needed. Use the new 
       dwarf_uncompress_integer_block_a() interface as it
       is easier to use.
2019-02-07 David Anderson
     * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
       dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h, dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
       Just a changed version string.
2019-02-07 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c: Use ifdef HAVE_ELF_H so non-elf
       builds work.
     * print_reloc.c: ifdef HAVE_ELF_H, eliminating
       the entire file of elf-header printing if elf.h
       missing.
2019-01-31 David Anderson
     * dwarfdump.c,dwconf.c,esb.c,print_abbrevs.c,
       print_aranges.c,print_die.c,print_macro.c,
       print_reloc.c,print_str_offsets.c: Fix warnings

    * globals.h: Remove the code for *UINT* and
      all the ifdefs involved. No longer needed.
    * print_die.c(get_FLAG_BLOCK_string): Remove 
      the__int32_t from this function (associated with
      DW_AT_SUN_func_offsets).  Simplify the printing
      of these offsets.

    * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated.
    * print_lines.c: If missing a line number do not
      supply a meaningless -1, supply 0.
      If line table access gets an error, print the error
      and attempt to continue.
    * dwarfdump.c: We try to continue after major errors
      in more places. If any major errors were seen
      a final line of text is reported to standard-out.
