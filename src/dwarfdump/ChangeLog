    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-af-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
      Regenerated with new version string.
2021-05-25 David Anderson
    * attr_form.c,command_options.c,compiler_info.c,dwarfdump.c,
      dwconf.c,print_tag_attributes_usage.c: Fixed indents,
      removed trailing whitespace.
2021-05-20 David Anderson
    * print_die.c: If a DW_OP_skip or DW_OP_bra
      went to a previous offset the correctness check
      did not find it and issued an erroneous error.
2021-05-16 David Anderson
    * runtests.sh: A few small temporary files were
      overlooked and left behind. Now they are deleted.
2021-03-06 David Anderson
    * command_options.c,dwconf.c: When a dwarfdump.conf
      is not findable the messages are now more meaningful
      and not quite so mysterious.
      Added new option --show-dwarfdump-conf to show
      the .dwarfdump.conf in use. The old and broken
      depencence on -v is gone.
    * glflags.c,glflags.h: New flag gf_show_dwarfdump_conf
      for the new option. 
    * dwarfdump.1: Documented new option --show-dwarfdump-conf
2021-03-05 David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-af-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
      Regenerated with new version string.
2021-03-05 David Anderson
    * dwconf.c: In case no dwarfdump.conf file found
      in one of the standard places (such as $HOME)
      the message printed is much clearer
      and more specific.
2021-02-24 David Anderson
    * attr_form_build.c: Catastophic error texts
      now all have a trailing newline.
    * attr_formclass_ext.list: The _ghs_
      attributes are now properly named as GreenHillls
      spells them
    * dwarf_names.c: Regenerated with the proper
      _ghs_ names.
    * dwarfdump-af-table.h,dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h: Regenerated
      with the proper _ghs_ names.
2021-02-20 David Anderson
    * tag_attr.c,tag_tree.c: When creating 
      the tables below insert the precise array
      length in the array declarations so the 
      compiler can check them.
    * dwarfdump-ta-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
      Regenerated, now with precise array sizes
      everywhere.
2021-02-19 David Anderson
    * attr_form.c: Now checks attr/form-class
      combinations and reports on them. The -ku
      option lets one see interesting counts
      without details cluttering the output.
    * attr_form.h: Argument list updates
      to support latest functionality.
    * attr_formclass.list,attr_formclass_ext.list:
      New declarations of attr/formclass combinations
      one expects to see. No doubt there will be
      more such to do.
    * attr_form_build.c: Deleted unused locals,
      fixing some compiler warnings.
    * dwarf_names.h: Regenerated.
    * dwarfdump-af-table.h: Regenerated the attr/formclass
      table.
    * dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h: New extensions added.
    * dwarfdump-tt-table.h: Regenerated with explicit
      array sizes so compilers can check array references.
    * dwarfdump.c: Added calls to certain cleanups
      that have long been needed for correct
      -ku output when reading an Elf Archive
    * glflags.h: Added a new Dwarf_Check_Catetories entry
      of attr_formclass_result.
    * globals.h: New function declarations for
      form_class and tag-tree tag-attr counts
      in the Elf archive case.
    * print_die.c: Added arguments to record_attr_form_use
      now that we check and count usages.
    * print_tag_attributes_usage.c(reset_usage_rate_tag_tree): 
      added reset function so printing of Elf archive
      member objects usages are correct.
    * tag_attr_ext.list: Added GHS attributes to list.
    * tag_common.h: Increased column counts due to 
      adding the GHS attributes to tag_attr_ext.list.
    * tag_tree.c: Added array size to emitted C
      source so compiler can check references when
      that emitted source is built into dwarfdump.
2021-02-16 David Anderson
    * command_options.c,compiler_info.c,glflags.c,
      glflags.h,print_tag_attributes_usage.c: 
      sed 's/gf_check_attr_tag/gf_check_tag_attr/' fixed the
      ever-confusing name reversal unique to this flag.
    * print_die.c,dwarfdump.c: The above plus correcting
      minor mistakes in handling of -ku -kuf options.
    * dwarfdump.1: Clarified the meaning and use of
      -kr -ku -kuf -C as the descriptions have been
      misleading for a long time.
2021-02-16 David Anderson
    * attr_form.c: Fixed indents and trailing whitespace.
    * dwarfdump.c: Fixed trailing whitespace.
    * print_die.c(append_useful_die_name): was not doing
      proper dealloc (which only mattered if one
      had turned off automatic cleanup at dwarf_finish()),
      but now it deallocs as desired.
2021-02-15 David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarfdump-af-table.h,
      dwarfdump-ta-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-ta-table.h,
      dwarfdump-tt-ext-table.h,dwarfdump-tt-table.h:
      Regenerated with new version string.

      reports with the existing -kE option.
    * globals.h: Renamed tag_specific_checks_setup()
      to tag_specific_globals_setup() to better reflect
      the meaning of the function.
    * attr_form.h: Added declaration so dwarfdump.c can
      call attr_form.c functions. Added idempotency
      in include and __cplusplus ifdefs.

      code when generating dwarfdump-af-table.h.
    * dwarf_tsearch.h: Commentary improvements.

      get_FORM_CLASS_name() to both.
    * print_abbrevs.c: Renaming per globals.h function rename.
    * print_die.c: Include attr_form.h, call
      record_attr_form_use(). Renamin here too per
      the globals.h function rename.
    * attr_form_build.c: Added idempotency
      and __cplusplus guards to the output 
      file generated: dwarfdump-af-table.h.
    * print_tag_attributes_usage.c: Improvements in
      the specificity of some summary header lines.
      Now calls print_attr_form_usage() to print
      the attr/formclass/form tables (option -kE
      or -ka ).
    * tag_common.c: Removed unused local variables.
    * test-mach-o-32.base,testobjLE32PE.base,testuriLE64ELf.base,
      New baseline based on recent changes.
2021-02-14 David Anderson

      the new file print_tag_attributes_usage.c.
    * tag_common.c: Fixed large indent botch.
    * globals.h: Now with  print_tag_attributes_usage,
      record_tag_usage, legal_tag_attr_combination,
      legal_tag_tree_combination public for access from
      print_die.c.
    * dwarfdump.c: Reflects the simpler arguments to
      call print_tag_attributes_usage().
2021-02-14 David Anderson
    * Makefile.am: Added print_tag_attributes_usage.c
    * print_tag_attributes_usage.c: New file. Extracted
      this code (which prints a summary of tag/attr use)
      from print_die.c and put in this new file.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.  
    * dwarfdump.1: Made the description of -kE a bit more
      specific.
2021-02-14 David Anderson

      trailing whitespace.
2021-02-14 David Anderson
    * attr_form.c,attr_form.h,attr_form_build.c: Code to build
      and use date for recording and checking attr/form
      combinations. Not yet used by dwarfdump.
    * attr_formclass.list: List of standard attr/form-class
      combinations.
    * attr_formclass_ext.list: List of extension attr/form-class
      combinations.

      names into their enum values.
    * tag_common.h: Added define of HAVE_USAGE_ATTR_FORMCLASS 
      (not strictly necessary at this point).
2021-02-13 David Anderson
    * print_die.c: Somehow hundreds of lines got indented
      4 spaces for no reason. Fixed that mistake.
      Added a trailing > where intended in printing
      DW_AT_decl_file when the file name is unavailable.
2021-02-06 David Anderson
    * print_die.c: Refactoring for clarity and adding
      following DW_FORM_ref_sig8 links to find DW_AT_type
      targets. Also reporting line table file numbers
      as file names.
2021-01-31 David Anderson
    * dwarfdump.c: Ensures ERROR printf appear in the error count
      (A couple errors printed at the end were not counted.)
    * globals.h: Defining LoHiPc_s struct so we can calculate
      the high_pc from low_pc and offset-from-low-pc values.
      Simpler and better type checking than before.
    * print_die.c: Eliminate sets of 4 arguments,
      replace with LoHiPc pointer.
    * print_hipc_lopc_attr.c: Implement filling in
      LoHiPc_s and printing the calculated high_pc
      when appropriate.  Much easier to understand than
      the earlier use of bSawLowp etc. 
2021-01-29 David Anderson
   * tag_attr_ext.list: Added some DW_AT_GNU entries to
     DW_TAG_skeleton unit as common extensions.
2021-01-29 David Anderson

     aspect of a couple arrays here. 
   * dwarfdump.c: Removed a stray back-quote from a comment.
   * print_die.c: Revised printing of dwarf expressions
     and ensured such appear in more places. Revised error
     detection of attributes requiring a string yet
     that do not have any sort of string FORM.
     Some #if 0 present to be removed shortly.
   * print_hipc_lopc_attr.c: A new #if 0 here is a non-functional
     improvment in printing high-pc. Not ready for prime time.
   * print_origloclist_codes.c: added DW_LLE_start_end case
     seen in test object.
2021-01-23 David Anderson

     tag_common.c,tag_tree.c,testesb.c: Fixed indentation
     errors.

2021-01-23 David Anderson
   * print_die.c: Now checks all instances of DW_OP_bra
     and DW_OP_skip to be sure the target offset actually
     is a valid target in this expression block.
2021-01-22 David Anderson
   * glflags.h: Moved _dwarf_print_one_expr_op() out,
     it is now static in print_die.c
   * print_die.c: Now notices if DW_OP_skip or DW_OP_bra
     is in a set of operations and prefixes each operation
     with its block offset so its easy to understand the target
     offset.
