/*
    _dwarf_exec_frame_instr() is the heart of the
    debug_frame stuff.  Don't even
    think of reading this without reading both the Libdwarf
    and consumer API carefully first.  This function
    executes frame instructions contained in a Cie or an
    Fde, but does in a number of different ways depending
    on the information sought.  Start_instr_ptr points
    to the first byte of the frame instruction stream,
    and final_instr_ptr one past the last byte.

    In addition have the structs Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3_s
    and struct Dwarf_Regtable3_s from libdwarf.h
    on hand to refer to.  From dwarf_frame.h:
    Dwarf_Frame_s, Dwarf_Cie_s, and Dwarf_Fde_s.

    The function begins reading instructions from the beginning
    at initial_loc, the low pc of the FDE, but
    starting with the CIE initial instructions
    to prime the set of instructions. Always.
    (Any CIE instructions are remembered in the CIE
    so do not need to be re-evaluated)

    The offsets returned in the frame instructions are
    factored.  That is they need to be multiplied by either
    the code_alignment_factor or the data_alignment_factor,
    as appropriate to obtain the actual offset.  This makes
    it possible to expand an instruction stream without the
    corresponding Cie.  However, when an Fde frame instr
    sequence is being expanded there must be a valid Cie
    with a pointer to an initial table row.

    If successful, returns DW_DLV_OK
        And sets returned_count thru the pointer
        if make_instr is TRUE.
        If make_instr is FALSE returned_count
        should NOT be used by the caller (returned_count
        is set to 0 thru the pointer by this routine...)
    If unsuccessful, returns DW_DLV_ERROR
        and sets returned_error to the error code

    It does not do a whole lot of input validation being a private
    function.  Please make sure inputs are valid.

    (Option 1) If make_instr is TRUE, it makes a list of pointers
    to Dwarf_Frame_Op structures containing an easy to
    parse intermediate language representing the frame
    instructions involved.  A pointer to this list is
    returned in ret_frame_instr.  Make_instr is TRUE only
    when a list of frame instructions is to be returned.
    In this case since we are not interested in the
    contents of the table, the input Cie can be NULL.
    This is the only case where the input Cie can be NULL.
    The table argument is NULL.
    Only called this way from dwarf_expand_frame_instructions()

    (Option 2) If search_pc is TRUE, frame instructions are
    executed till either a location is reached that
    is greater than the search_pc_val provided, or all
    instructions are executed.  At this point the last
    row of the table generated is returned in a structure.
    A pointer to this structure is supplied in table.

    (Option 3) This function is also used to create the
    initial table row defined by a Cie.  In this case,
    the Dwarf_Cie pointer cie, is NULL.  For an FDE,
    however, cie points to the associated Cie.  Option (5)
    is FALSE in this case.

    (Option 4) If search_pc is TRUE and (has_more_rows and
        subsequent_pc are non-null) then:
            has_more_rows is set TRUE if there are instruction
            bytes following the detection of search_over.
            If all the instruction bytes have been seen
            then *has_more_rows is set FALSE.

            If *has_more_rows is TRUE then *subsequent_pc
            is set to the pc value that is the following
            row in the table.

    (Option 5) if  iter_data is non-null  we are not returning
        data of interest here, but we are calling a
        user-written function to return row user data.
        We will iterate through all the rows in the
        fde  and call the callback function with each
        row. In this case (1),(2),(3), and (4) are FALSE.

    make_instr - make list of frame instr? 0/1
    ret_frame_instr -  Ptr to list of ptrs to frame instrs
    search_pc  - Search for a pc value?  0/1
    search_pc_val -  Search for this pc value
    initial_loc - Initial code location value, low pc
        of the fde.
    start_instr_ptr -   Ptr to start of frame instrs.
    final_instr_ptr -   Ptr just past frame instrs.
    table       -     Ptr to struct with last row.
    cie     -   Ptr to Cie used by the Fde.
    iter_data - data used when iterating using a
        callback function.

    Different cies may have distinct address-sizes, so the cie
    is used, not de_pointer_size.
