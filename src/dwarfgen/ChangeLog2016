    * Makefile.in: Clean *~
2016-11-20  David Anderson
     * Makefile.in: Now we have proper setting of CC
       and CFLAGS, which was missing before.

     * dwarfgen.cc:For the reporting of .debug_str 
       stats (just 3 lines of it)
       there is now a fixed prefix "Debug_Str:" so it is easier to
       verify things do not go wrong over time by just comparing
       those few lines, which should match across
       and across OS and libelf versions. There will still
       be 32/64bit differences though as the notion of 'short'
       string is longer with a 64bit offset in an object..
       (pointer size is not the issue).

     * dwarfgen.cc: Now calls dwarf_pro_get_string_stats()
       and prints the string counts information.
2016-08-25  David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: Clarified and expanded the debug output of dwarfgen
       about relocations (and added the -r option to expand
       the output further).
     * irepresentation.h: Added comments explaining the intent
       of two small classes.
2016-08-23  David Anderson
     * dwarfgen.cc: Added the -s option which has .debug_info strings
       generated into .debug_str.
