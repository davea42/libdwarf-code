Added frame2.c which uses the new dwarf_iterate_fde_all_regs3()
to get a report of all rows in all fdes.
Example frame1.c continues to use the original set of functions
to get a similar report, and can do additional reports.

Both frame1.c and frame2.c support option
--skip-all-printf
which means times (as in time(1))
are then independent of printf time.

frame1.c runtime just getting all rows in each FDE
is of order(n*n/2) in the number of frame rows of an FDE.
frame2.c runtime just getting all rows in each FDE
is of order(n) in the number of frame rows of an FDE.

  Renamed getdebuglink to dwdebuglink and added the ability
  fo find the debuglink target properly.

  Added getdebuglink.c to show how to use libdwarf to find a GNU alternate
  DWARF file.
  Add dummyexample.c as a trivial C test case, compiled into
  the file dummyexample.  Compiled as
  cc -g dummyexample.c -o dummyexample
  This dummyexample (the executable) is a static, unchanging, file
  that getdebuglink can use in runtests.sh to verify getdebuglink
  works.

  simplereader.c: Added the --dumpallnames option so one can
  get all the strings from debug_info,_types into a file.
  A simple way to enable further examination of the strings.

  Roni Simonian noticed a call to  print_die_data(dbg,cur_die,in_level);
  was missing so not all DIEs would print.  Good Catch!

  Created a sample libdwarf consumer. Using BSD license so
  anyone can use it.  And a trivial Makefile.
