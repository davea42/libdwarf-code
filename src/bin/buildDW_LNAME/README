Created 25 October 2025
The intent of this is to build a new
sourcefile dwarf_lname_version.c 
with function
int dwarf_language_version_data(
    Dwarf_Unsigned dw_lang_name,
    int          *dw_default_lower_bound,
    const char   **dw_version_scheme)
in the libdwarf source.

based on the content in dwarf_lname_data.h
and we also verify that dwarf.h has the same
base of LNAMEs as dwarf_lname_data.h


After updating the libdwarf build for this
we will remove that function from libdwarf/dwarf_query.c
