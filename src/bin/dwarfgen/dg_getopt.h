/*  Modified by David Anderson to work with GNU/Linux and freebsd.
    Added {} for clarity.
    Switched to standard dwarfdump formatting.
    Treatment of : modified so that :: gets dwoptarg NULL
    if space follows the letter
    (the dwoptarg is set to null).

/*  As of October 2017 it seems advisable to allow
    long option names.  So based on a reading of
    'man 3 getopt' we reimplement a portion of GNU getopt_long().
    It's a wonderfully sensible design and all the credit
    should go to the original designers.
    We are not implementing all the features of GNU/Linux
    getopt_long(), just the features we wish to use.
    Specifically, we require val be 0 and flag
    be NULL and ignore those fields.
    We do not implement GNU digit_optind at all.
    Within these restrictions the interface behaves the same
    as GNU getopt_long() (or so it appears from the
    getopt documentation:
    release 4.04 of the Linux man-pages project,
    GETOPT(3),
    http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/).
