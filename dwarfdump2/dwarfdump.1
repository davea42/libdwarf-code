.TH DWARFDUMP
.SH NAME
dwarfdump \- dumps DWARF debug information of an ELF object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwarfdump
[-abcdefilmoprsvy] [-k{aefrty}]  [-t{afv}] [-u\f2cuname\fP] \f2objectfilename\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B dwarfdump
command prints DWARF sections as requested by specific options.
With no options (but with the required \f2objectfilename\fP ) 
all sections print.
.PP
The format is intended to be human readable.
If a script is to parse the output, the
.B \-d
option is useful.
.P
Not all sections actually exist in any given object file.
.P
The format may change from release to release, so it is
unwise to depend too heavily on the format.
.P
.PP
Frame information (.debug_frame and .eh_frame) is heavily
dependent on the ABI/ISA of the object file.  
By default we use a generic set of register names
handling up to 100 registers named r0-100.
The '-R' option uses a built-in generic register name set
handling up to 1200 registers named r0-r1199.
The '-x abi=<abi>'
description below shows how to name an abi and use that to guide
the -f or -F processing.
Unless the cpu for the object file being dumped has many registers,
do not use -R or -x abi=generic as those can be needlessly 
slow dumping frame sections. Instead, use the correct
abi (if it exists in dwarfdump.conf) or a generic such
as -x abi=generic100 or -x abi=generic500.
To get MIPS/IRIX register names names and call the old version 2 libdwarf
frame interface use the option '-x abi=mips'.
Without '-R' or '-x abi=<abi>' dwarfdump ignores
the dwarfdump.conf file and uses compiled-in generic set of
register names.
If no '-x name=<path>' is given, dwarfdump
looks for "./dwarfdump.conf", "$HOME/.dwarfdump.conf", "<install-prefix>/lib/dwarfdump.conf" and takes the first it finds.
If one or more '-x name=<path>' is given the last of these is
used and all other such files are ignored.
.PP
Some -k (checking) options print so-called harmless errors.
These are compiler errors that do not cause any
known problem and are only detected inside libdwarf itself.
These are difficult to properly report in dwarfdump and
any error strings may not appear close to the time the
error was encountered.
.PP
The 
.B dwarfdump
command accepts one or more of the following options:
.RS
.TP
.B \-a
Dumps most sections.
Same as 
.B \-bcfilmoprsy
.BR \-tfv .
.TP
.B \-b
Dumps the .debug_abbrev section.  
.TP
.B \-c
Dumps the .debug_loc section.
There is no guarantee in the DWARF standard that
just scanning the bytes like this will print the section
correctly, only the -i output is really guaranteed by DWARF to
find ranges correctly. But it will often work
and the output may be of value to compiler-writers.
.TP
.B \-C
Activate warnings about some common
extensions to DWARF in the .debug_info section.
.TP
.B \-d
Dense mode.  Each die information of the .debug_info section is 
printed in one-line format.  This option does not imply \fB\-i\fP.  
.TP
.B \-e
Ellipsis mode.  Short names for DW_TAG_* and DW_ATTR_* are used 
in the output for the .debug_info section.  
.TP
.B \-f
Dumps the .debug_frame section.
.TP
.B \-i
Dumps the .debug_info section.
.TP
.B \-ka
Adds all available error checks to whatever sections
are being read. At the end of the run prints the
instances inspected and the number of errors for each
type of check.  If there are more than zero errors
the compiler has emitted invalid DWARF.
.TP
.B \-l
Dumps the .debug_line information.  
.TP
.B \-m
Dumps the .debug_macinfo section.
.TP
.B \-M
Dumps the form name for each attribute in each die
entry printed, and if the form is the indirect form
notes that too.
If combined with -v it also prints the form number.
.TP
.B \-n
Supress function name lookup for the .debug_frame
and .eh_frame sections. This can
speed up  printing of these sections.
.TP
.B \-N
Dumps the .debug_ranges section.
There is no guarantee in the DWARF standard that
just scanning the bytes like this will print the section
correctly, only the -i output is really guaranteed by DWARF to
find ranges correctly. But it will normally work
and the output may be of value to compiler-writers.
This section is not dumped by -a, but -a and -i
dump the ranges data applicable to each 
DW_AT_ranges attribute.
.TP
.B \-o
Dumps the .reloc_debug_* sections.
.TP
.B \-p
Dumps the .debug_pubnames section.
.TP
.B \-r
Dumps the .debug_aranges section.
.TP
.B \-s
Dumps .debug_string section.
.TP
.B \-S match=<string>
Examines the .debug_info section and for each die with
an attribute containing exactly that string 
(case matters)
it prints the die-owner-tree
from the compilation unit to the die containing the string. 
The string matching is done on the printable form, so addresses
are matched as strings.   So    "dwarfdump -S match=main a.out"
will print the main program die and the compilation unit die
(assuming there is a "main" in a.out).
Previously printed dies are not reprinted.
.TP
.B \-S any=<string>
Examines the .debug_info section and for each die with
an attribute containing that substring (case is ignored)
it prints the die-owner-tree
from the compilation unit to the die containing the string. 
The string matching is done on the printable form, so addresses
are matched as strings.   
So    "dwarfdump -S any=main a.out"
will print the each die with an attribute with the letters "main"
(and the die tree owning this die).
Previously printed dies are not reprinted.
.B \-S regex=<string>
If POSIX regular expressions are present at build time
and detected by the build, this
examines the .debug_info section and for each die with
an attribute that matches the  regular expression presented
it prints the die-owner-tree
from the compilation unit to the die containing the string. 
The string matching is done on the printable form, so addresses
are matched as strings.   So    "dwarfdump -S regex=ma.n a.out"
will print the each die with an attribute containing a string
such as "main" or "maxn" ( any string matching the regular expression)
(and the die tree owning this die).
You may find it necessary to quote the  "regex=<string>"
so that your shell will not transform the expression.
Previously printed dies are not reprinted.
.TP
.B \-ta
Same as 
.B \-tfv.
.TP
.B \-tf
Dumps the .debug_static_funcs section.
.TP
.B \-tv
Dumps the .debug_static_vars section.
.TP
.BI \-u cuname
Restricts the dumping of sections to dump only 
sections of the named compilation unit.
If the compilation unit name in DWARF is a relative path
(meaning it does not start with a slash (/) but contains at least one
slash) any characters before (and including) the final slash
in the compilation unit name in DWARF are ignored in this comparision.
If the compilation unit name is a full path(meaning it starts with
a slash(/)) or has no slashes, then the DWARF compilation unit name
as a whole is compared with the cuname in this option.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Shows more detailed information.
Prints the abbreviation index for each DIE (on its DW_TAG line).  
More detailed information about the .debug_frame section prints if
2 or 3 
.B \-v
options are given.
.TP
.B \-w
Dumps the .debug_weaknames section.
.TP
.B \-x abi=<abiname>
where abi=names an abi in dwarfdump.conf (see the
abiname: command in dwarfdump.conf).
The abinames defined at this time in dwarfdump.conf are
mips ia64 x86 x86_64 m68k ppc generic generic500 generic100 .
If the cpu has relatively few registers use of -x abi=generic 
(or the -R option, see above) will
needlessly slow down printing of the frame sections, so
use the correct abi or generic100  (or for a machine
with more than 100 registers but under 500 use generic500).
.TP
.B \-x name=<conf>
where name=names the full pathname of a dwarfdump configuration
file.  Default install location is /usr/local/lib/dwarfdump.conf.
dwarfdump looks first for local ./dwarfdump.conf, then
for $HOME/.dwarfdump.conf then  for  /usr/local/lib/dwarfdump.conf.
.TP
.B \-y
Dumps the .debug_types section.
.SH FILES
dwarfdump
./dwarfdump.conf
$(HOME)/.dwarfdump.conf
<install-prefix>/lib/dwarfdump.conf
.SH NOTES
In some cases compilers use DW_FORM_data1 (for example)
and in such cases the signedness of the value must be taken
from context. Rather than attempt to determine the
context, dwarfdump prints the value with both signednesses
whenever there is ambiguity about the correct interpretation.
For example, 
"DW_AT_const_value           176(as signed = -80)".
For normal DWARF consumers that correctly and fully
evaluate all attributes there is no ambiguity of signedness:
the ambiguity for dwarfdump is due to dwarfdump evaluating
DIEs in a simple order and not keeping track of much context.
.SH BUGS
Support for DWARF3 is being completed but may not be complete.
