    Changed the default frame-data register names from MIPS to
    a generic set of registers.  
    Try  '-x abi=mips' to get the traditional old MIPS register
    naming.

    Added the -S option to dwarfdump.
June 10, 2009
    Moved the gennames.c code to libdwarf.
May 4, 2009
    Replaced awk source-generation of certain functions 
    with new gennames.c code.

    Now frame printing (-f and -F) uses a different interface
    to libdwarf which is far more efficient for the particular
    purpose of printing all the register rules.  Reduces
    MxN print time to M (one extreme case reduces from 2 hours
    to 2 minutes).

    Created this new source base in C++ (from dwarfdump, which
    is C).
