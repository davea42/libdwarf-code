/*  When each block is allocated, there is a two-word structure
    allocated at the beginning so the block can go on a list.
    The address returned is the address *after* the two pointers
    at the start.  But this allows us to be given a pointer to
    a generic block, and go backwards to find the list-node.  Then
    we can remove this block from it's list without the need to search
    through a linked list in order to remove the node.  It also allows
    us to 'delete' a memory block without needing the dbg structure.
    We still need the dbg structure on allocation so
    that we know which
    linked list to add the block to.

    Only the allocation of the dbg structure itself cannot use
    _dwarf_p_get_alloc.
    That structure should be set up by hand, and the two list
    pointers should be initialized to point at the node itself.
    That initializes
    the doubly linked list.  */
