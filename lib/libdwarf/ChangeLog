2021-05-25  David Anderson
    * dwarf_crc32.c: Added a comment for the Windows case
      in case it will help someone. I have no way to

2021-05-20  David Anderson
    * dwarf_line.h: Modified libdwarf-internal functions
      for LNCT handlng. Added a couple new functions 
      for that as well. Added new fields for reporting the DW_LNCT
      extensions beyond DWARF5.
    * dwarf_line.c: New helper functions to report properly
      on errors in DW_LNCT forms.
      Completed handling of DWARF5 DW_LNCT and its FORMs.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Modified calls
      of the LNCT reading/checking for completeness.
      Moved some array/member refs to make the calls
      to _dwarf_decode_line_udata_form etc (all to do
      with DW_LNCT values).
    * dwarf_print_lines.c: Now prints the DW_LNCT extensions.
2021-05-18  David Anderson

      _dwarf_extract_local_debug_str_string_given_offset
      for DW_FORM_line_strp.
    * dwarf_query.c: In _dwarf_die_attr_unsigned_constant()
      allow DW_FORM_implicit_const and add some
      comments on small functions.
      Return error and DW_DLE_NEGATIVE_SIZE in case
      the form is a negative implicit const.
2021-05-18  David Anderson
    * pdfbld.sh: Comment out the build of the rearranged
      (placing the table of contents at the front)
      libdwarf2.1.pdf as that version is 20MiB!
    * CMakeLists.txt: Moved the install  of libdwarf stuff
      here from ../CMakeLists.txt so it works for cmake before
      and after cmake 3.13.
      Repair an old ommission in an install that
      modern cmake seemingly did not care if
      repaired or not.
2021-05-15  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Added additional explanation
      of an example call to the library  in the 
      Dwarf_Error section. Now rev 3.27.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated. Version 3.27.
2021-05-13  David Anderson
    * test_dwarfstring.c,test_headersok.c,test_linkedtopath.c:
      Changes made to avoid compiler warnings.
2021-05-11  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Corrected errors in the formatting
      of a couple input lines to get consistency.
      the output in the pdf doex not change. Ver 3.26
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated as 3.26
2021-04-20  David Anderson
    * dwarf_leb.c: Now reads uleb/sleb allowing
      zeroes padding at the end.
    * dwarf_leb_test.c: Additional tests added with
      constructed examples with zeroes padding and
      comments explaining how it all works. See
      tests v5, v6, and v7.
2021-04-20  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, no change intended.
    * pdfbld.sh: Now build the consumer both in
      standard and bloated form (we only ship the
      standard form).
2021-03-07  David Anderson
    * pdfbld.sh: Abandon the rearrangement  of the pdf,
      it bloated the pdf from 600KB to over 14MB.
      and would double the size of a release.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2021-03-05  David Anderson
    * libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.
    * dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,dwarf_names_new.h,
      dwarf_names.c:  Regenerated.
2021-02-24  David Anderson
    * dwarf.h: Now with the properly spelled _ghs_ names.
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names_enum.h: Regenerated
      with the properly 
      spelled _ghs_ names.
2021-02-19  David Anderson
    * dwarf.h: Many DWARF-extension name/value pairs were made
      available to me, so those are now in dwarf.h. 
    * dwarf_abbrev.c: An error issue with a corrupted
      object lead to an errormessage that read very
      confusingly.  I've updated the message to be
      a bit clearer.
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names_enum.h: Regenerated.
    * dwarf_query.c(dw_get_special_offset): Updated 
      so we get some additional form classes report d
      correctly on certain DW_AT extensions to the
      standard..
    * gennames.c: More names, so a constant used
      to generate .c and .h files needed to go 300->350.
      The array is only used to build C source code and
      does not appear in libdwarf or dwarfdump.
2021-02-16  David Anderson
    * dwarf_query.c: Removed a () that was accidental.
    * dwarf_form_class_names.c: Removed a trailing space.
2021-02-15  David Anderson
    * libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.

      Removed a couple blank lines.
    * dwarf_find_sigref.c,dwarf_line.c: Fixing indents
      and trailing whitespace.
2021-02-12  David Anderson
    * dwarf_find_sigref.c: Deleted two pointless
      blank lines.
    * libdwarf.h.in: The dwarf_find_die_given_sig8 prototype
      showed actual argument names. Now those names hidden
      in comments.
    * generates_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
2021-02-06  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Adding dwarf_find_sigref.c which follows
      DW_FORM_ref_sig8 to report targets.
    * Makefile.am: Adding dwarf_find_sigref.c which follows
      DW_FORM_ref_sig8 to report targets.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
    * dwarf_abbrev.c: Deleted a blank line.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Additional minor refactoring for clarity
      and reuse.
    * dwarf_find_sigref.c: Now correctly finds the ref_sig8
      targets.  Does not yet reference any tied-file.
    * dwarf_line.c: Minor refactoring to focus on the 
      code flow, but also allowing (and reporting)
      when a compiler erroneously used DW_FORM_addr
      on DW_AT_stmt_list.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: refactored new CU context
      functions now availablt
      to dwarf_find_sigref.c.
    * libdwarf.h.in: New function dwarf_find_die_given_sig8()
      lets callers follow the references.
      Not yet documented in libdwarf2.1.mm.
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
2021-02-04  David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Refactored the code creating
      CU_Context records, removing duplicated code to
      three new small functions: calculate_next_cu_context_offset(),
      create_a_new_cu_context_record_on_list() and
      load_die_containing_section(). Much easier to understand
      the flow now. 
    * dwarf_form.c: Clarified a comment.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Corrected a comment about cc_unit_type
      field.
    * dwarf_tied.c: Corrected commentary about reading CUs.
2021-02-02  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.25. Documents
      dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS_name().
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.25. Regenerated
2021-02-02  David Anderson
    * dwarf_form_class_names.c: new. Lets library clients
      print the name of any enum Dwarf_Form_Class variable
      by calling dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS name().
    * CMakeLists.txt,Makefile.am: Now builds
      dwarf_form_class_names.c.
    * Makefile.in:Regenerated.
    * libdwarf.h.in: Adds prototype for
      dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS name().
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
2021-01-31  David Anderson
    * dwarf_form.c(dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed): For better
      readability a chain of if-statements is now a switch/case.
2021-01-28  David Anderson
    * checkexamples.c,crc32.c,dwarf_alloc.c,dwarf_arange.c,
      dwarf_debuglink.c,dwarf_die_deli,.c,dwarf_elf_access.c,
      dwarf_elf_load_headers.c,dwarf_elfread.c,dwarf_form.c,

      Fix indents.
2021-01-28  David Anderson
    * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Rev 1.53. Added a few words
      about relocating DW_OP_addr data: Such relocation
      generation only works right
      if the DW_OP_addr is the very first DW_OP
      in the expression.
    * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Rev 1.53. Regenerated.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.24. A font-marker
      was missing a \ so from page 252 the fonts
      were mixed up.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.24. Regenerated
