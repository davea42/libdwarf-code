.AS 1
This document describes an interface to a library of functions
to access DWARF debugging information entries, DWARF line number
information, and other DWARF2/3/4/5 information).
.P
There are a few sections which are SGI-specific (those
are clearly identified in the document).
.P
Starting December 2020 we rearrange the pdf that
GNU groff -mm gives us (mm is not exceptionally flexible)
using tools pdftotext, pdfseparate, and pdfunite from
the poppler-utils package for debian/ubuntu.
We hope the new arrangement with the table of contents following
this page followed by the library documentation itself
makes the document easier to navigate.

.H 1 "INTRODUCTION"
This document describes an interface to \fIlibdwarf\fP, a
library of functions to provide access to DWARF debugging information
records, DWARF line number information, DWARF address range and global
names information, weak names information, DWARF frame description
information, DWARF static function names, DWARF static variables, and
DWARF type information.
.P
The document has long mentioned the
"Unix International Programming Languages Special Interest Group"
(PLSIG), under whose auspices the
DWARF committee was formed around 1991.
"Unix International"
was disbanded in the 1990s and no longer exists.
.P
The DWARF committee published DWARF2 July 27, 1993.
.P
In the mid 1990s this document and the library it describes
(which the committee never endorsed, having decided
not to endorse or approve any particular library interface)
was made available on the internet by Silicon Graphics, Inc.
.P
In 2005 the DWARF committee began an affiliation with FreeStandards.org.
In 2007 FreeStandards.org merged with The Linux Foundation.
The DWARF committee dropped its affiliation with FreeStandards.org
in 2007 and established the dwarfstd.org website.
See "http://www.dwarfstd.org" for current
information on standardization activities
and a copy of the standard.

WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

.H 2 "Purpose and Scope"
The purpose of this document is to document a library of functions
to access DWARF debugging information. There is no effort made in
this document to address the creation of these records as those
issues are addressed separately
(see "A Producer Library Interface to DWARF").

.P
Additionally, the focus of this document is the functional interface,
and as such, implementation as well as optimization issues are
intentionally ignored.


.H 2 "Document History"
.P
A document was written about 1991 which had similar
layout and interfaces.
Written by people from Hal Corporation,
That document described a library for reading DWARF1.
The authors distributed paper copies to the committee
with the clearly expressed intent to propose the document as
a supported interface definition.
The committee decided not to pursue a library definition.
.P
SGI wrote the document you are now reading in 1993
with a similar layout and content and organization, but
it was complete document rewrite with the intent to read DWARF2
(the DWARF version then in existence).
The intent was (and is) to also cover
future revisions of DWARF.
All the function interfaces were changed
in 1994 to uniformly
return a simple integer success-code (see DW_DLV_OK etc),
generally following
the recommendations in the chapter 
titled "Candy Machine Interfaces"
of "Writing Solid Code", a book by
Steve Maguire (published by Microsoft Press).
.H 2 "Definitions"
DWARF debugging information entries (DIEs)
are the segments of information
placed in the \f(CW.debug_*\fP sections
by compilers, assemblers, and
linkage editors that, in conjunction
with line number entries, are
necessary for symbolic source-level debugging.
Refer to the latest
"\fIDWARF Debugging Information Format\fP"
from www.dwarfstd.org for a more
complete description of these entries.

.P
This document adopts all the terms and
definitions in "\fIDWARF Debugging
Information Format\fP" versions 2,3,4, and 5.
It originally focused on the implementation at
Silicon Graphics, Inc., but now
attempts to be more generally useful.

.H 2 "Overview"
The remaining sections of this document
 describe the proposed interface
to \f(CWlibdwarf\fP, first by describing
 the purpose of additional types
defined by the interface, followed
 by descriptions of the available
operations.  
This document assumes you are thoroughly familiar with the
information contained in the
\fIDWARF Debugging Information Format\fP
document.
.P
We separate the functions into several
categories to emphasize that not
all consumers want to use all the functions.
We call the categories
Debugger, Internal-level, High-level, and 
Miscellaneous not because one is more
important than another but as a way of
making the rather large set of
function calls easier to understand.
.P
Unless otherwise specified,
all functions and structures should be
taken as being designed for Debugger consumers.
.P
The Debugger Interface of this library
is intended to be used by debuggers.
The interface is low-level (close to dwarf)
but suppresses irrelevant detail.
A debugger will want to absorb all of
some sections at startup and will
want to see little or nothing of some sections
except at need.  
And even
then will probably want to absorb only the
information in a single compilation
unit at a time.  A debugger does not care about
implementation details of the library.
.P
The Internal-level Interface is for a DWARF
prettyprinter and checker.
A thorough prettyprinter will want to know all kinds of
internal things (like actual FORM numbers and actual offsets)
so it can check for appropriate structure in the DWARF data
and print (on request) all that internal information for human
users and libdwarf authors and compiler-writers.  Calls in this
interface provide data a debugger does not normally care about.

.P
The High-level Interface is for higher level access (it
is not really a high level interface!).  Programs such
as disassemblers will want to be able to display relevant
information about functions and line numbers without having
to invest too much effort in looking at DWARF.

.P
The miscellaneous interface is just what is left over: the
error handler functions.

.P
The following is a brief mention of the changes in this
libdwarf from the libdwarf draft for DWARF Version 1 and
recent changes.

.H 2 "Items Changed"
.P
Added dwarf_get_FORM_CLASS_name()
so library uses can print a form
class value usefully.
2 February 2021.
.P
Added dwarf_decode_leb128() and dwarf_decode_signed_leb128()
so library users can access these library-internal functions.
.P
Added dwarf_macro_context_total_length()
because callers of dwarf_get_macro_context[_by_offset]()
sometimes want to know the length of ops  + header.
.P
The description of dwarf_srcfiles()
now reflects the difference
in line table handling between
DWARF5  and other line table versions.
If using dwarf_srcfiles() do
read its documentation here
(Section 6.14, page 117 in this
version).
.P
Added functions dwarf_crc32()
and dwarf_basic_crc32()
so libdwarf can check
debuglink/build-id
CRC values.
.P
Clarified the DW_DLC* 
value meaning here and in
libdwarf.h.
In the consumer/reader case
DW_DLC_READ
is zero and zero is the only
meaningful value to pass
as the 'access' argument
of dwarf_init(and the like)
consumer/reader
initialization functions.
All this has been true for many
years, it is only now being
clearly (one hopes) stated.
(September 28, 2020)
.P
Added dwarf_get_ranges_b()
so clients reading DWARF4 
split dwarf (a GNU extension)
can get the final offset of the ranges.
(September 10, 2020)
.P
All the 
dwarf_init*() and
dwarf_elf_init*() calls 
have always been able to return
DW_DLV_ERROR with a Dwarf_Error
pointer returned too.
We now update the advice on
dealing with this situation,
unifying with the rest of
libdwarf errors.
(September 9, 2020)
.P
The documentation of dwarf_init_path()
was basically correct but omitted
meaningful mention of the dbg argument
and a little wrongly described the error argument
(July 22, 2020);
.P
Added dwarf_get_debug_sup() to retrived the DWARF5
section .debug_sup content.
(July 13, 2020);
.P
Added new functions for 
reading .debug_gnu_pubtypes
and .debug_gnu_pubnames.
 dwarf_get_gnu_index_head()
dwarf_gnu_index_dealloc
dwarf_get_gnu_index_block()
dwarf_get_gnu_index_block_entry()
(July 9, 2020);
.P
Added new functions for full .debug_loclists
access:
dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d(),
dwarf_get_loclist_head_basics(),
dwarf_get_loclist_head_kind(), and
dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc().
For accessing certain DWARF5 new location
operators (for example DW_OP_const_type)
as well as all other operators we add
dwarf_get_location_op_value_d().
Added functions allowing simple reporting
of .debug_loclists without involving
other sections:
dwarf_load_loclists(),
dwarf_get_loclist_context_basics(),
dwarf_get_loclist_lle(),
dwarf_get_loclist_offset_index_value(),
and
dwarf_get_loclist_raw_entry_detail().
(June 10, 2020);
.P
Added new functions for full .debug_rnglists support
and fixed issues with DWARF5 .debug_addr
index FORMs.
New functions for general use:
dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed(),
dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields_a(),
dwarf_rnglists_get_rle_head(),
dwarf_dealloc_rnglists_head(),
New functions for a complete listing
of the .debug_rnglists section. 
dwarf_load_rnglists(),
dwarf_get_rnglist_offset_index_value(),
dwarf_get_rnglist_context(),
dwarf_get_rnglist_head_basics(),
dwarf_get_rnglist_context_basics(),
dwarf_get_rnglist_rle().
Also added new functions
dwarf_dealloc_die(), dwarf_dealloc_error(),
and dwarf_dealloc_attribute() to provide
type-safe calls for deallocation of the
specific data types.
(May 20, 2020)
.P
What was historically called 'length_size' in
libdwarf and dwarfdump is actually the size of
an offset (4 or 8 in DWARF2,3,4 and 5).
For readability all instances of 'length_size'
are being converted, as time permits,
to 'offset_size'.
(May 1, 2020)
.P
Added a new function dwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()
which allows turning-off of libdwarf-internal
allocation tracking to improve libdwarf
performance a few percent (which only
really matters with giant DWARF sections).
The downside of turning off the flag is
consumer code must do all the dwarf_dealloc()
calls itself to avoid memory leaks.
(March 14, 2020)

.P
Corrected the documentation of dwarf_diename:
It was never appropriate to use dwarf_dealloc
on the string pointer returned but
Up till now this document said such
a call was required.
(March 14, 2020)
.P
Now we document here
that if one uses dwarf_init() or
dwarf_init_b() or dwarf_init_path()
that the function dwarf_get_elf() 
cannot succeed as there is no longer
any Elf pointer (from libelf)
to return.
(November 26, 2019)
.P
New function  
dwarf_gnu_debuglink()
allow callers to access fields that
GNU compilers create and use to link an
executable to its separate
DWARF debugging content object file.
(September 9, 2019, updated October 2019)
.P
dwarf_next_cu_header_d() (and the other earlier
versions of this) now allow a null
in place of a pointer for next_cu_offset.
dwarf_hipc_b() now allows a null
in place of the return_form and/or
return_class arguments.
Unless you know a sufficiently recent
libdwarf is to be used it is not safe to
pass those arguments as null pointers.
This allowance of null is because
we've become aware that the relevant
NetBSD man pages 
on these functions incorrectly specified that
null was allowed.
(April 22,2019)
.P
The dwarf_elf_init() and dwarf_elf_init_b()
are now deprecated as they require the use
of elf.h and libelf.h and libelf. 
Use dwarf_init_path()
or
dwarf_init_b()
instead.
The new non-libelf reader code checks
elf header values more thoroughly
than libelf and detects corrupted Elf
earlier and in more cases than libelf.
Since the reports of elf corruption
from libdwarf/dwarfdump
are not detailed we suggest
one use an object dumper to
check the object file in question.
Two useful 
object dumpers are GNU readelf (part
of GNU binutils) and readelfobj
(part of the readelfobj project
on sourceforge.net).
readelfobj uses essentially the same
algorithms as libdwarf does and
should report something meaningful.
(April 20,2019)
.P
Added support for MacOS dSYM objects and
PE object files as well as an initialization
function allowing a path instead of a
Posix/Unix fd or a libelf Elf*.
(January 2019)
.P
Added a libdwarf interface dwarf_errmsg_by_number()
so that places in the code that can have errors but
do not want the Dwarf_Error complexities
can report more details than just an error number.
(December 19, 2018)
.P
Now Mach-o dSYM files containing dwarf
are readable by libdwarf and their DWARF
dumped by dwarfdump.
There are no new options or choices,
libdwarf and dwarfdump notice which
kind of object they are processing.
New functions added to libdwarf.h.in:
dwarf_init_path(),dwarf_object_detector_path(),
and dwarf_object_detector_fd().
(October 24, 2018)
.P
All references to Dwarf_Frame_Op3 have been removed
as that struct was never created or available.
The new function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_b()
is documented.
(May 12, 2018)
.P
With DWARF5 it became harder to use
dwarf_srclines_data_b() as DWARF5 changed
each line table header file table to zero-based
indexing from one-based (and made the primary
file index zero).
So a new function dwarf_srclines_file_indexes()
returns values that make it easy to step through
and call dwarf_srclines_data_b() sensibly whether
the line table is DWARF2,3,4, or 5.
(March 23, 2018)
.P
Added COMDAT support.
Recent compilers generate COMDAT sections (for some DWARF
information) routinely so this became important
recently. The new libdwarf COMDAT support
extends the groupnumber
idea as suggested just below.
(May 17, 2017)
.P
Adding dwarf_init_b() and dwarf_elf_init_b()
and dwarf_object_init_b() with a groupnumber
option added. DWARF5 adds split-dwarf and
we call original sections like .debug_info
group one and new sections like .debug_info.dwo
group two.
It has not escaped our attention that this
numbering can be extended to deal with
Elf COMDAT
section groups of DWARF information, though
COMDAT groups are not currently supported.
(April 02, 2017)
.P
Adding support for DWARF5 .debug_loc.dwo
and split dwarf range tables.
Added dwarf_get_offset_size().
(November 08, 2015)
.P
Adding support for reading DWARF5 line tables
and GNU two-level line tables.
The function dwarf_srclines() still works
but those using DWARF4 or DWARF5 are
advised to switch to dwarf_srclines_b().
dwarf_srclines()
cannot handle skeleton line tables sensibly
and a new interface was needed for two-level
line tables so the new approach satisfies both.
(October 5,2015)
.P
Adding support for Package Files (DWARF5)
to enable access of address data using DW_FORM_addrx.
See dwarf_set_tied_dbg().
(September 13, 2015)
.P
Adding some DWARF5 support and improved DWP Package File
support, using dwarf_next_cu_header_d().
.P
Added a note about dwarf_errmsg(): the string pointer
returned should be considered ephemeral, not a
string which remains valid permanently.
User code should print it or copy it before calling
other libdwarf functions on the specific Dwarf_Debug
instance.
(May 15, 2014)
.P
Added a printf-callback so libdwarf will not actually print
to \f(CWstdout\fP.
Added dwarf_highpc_b()
so return of a DWARF4 DW_AT_high_pc of class constant
can be returned properly.
(August 15 2013)
.P
Defined how the new operator DW_OP_GNU_const_type is handled.
(January 26 2013)
.P
Added dwarf_loclist_from_expr_b()
function which adds arguments of the DWARF version
(2 for DWARF2, etc) and the offset size
to the dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
function.  Because the DW_OP_GNU_implicit_pointer
opcode is defined differently for DWARF2 than for
later versions.
(November 2012)
.P
Added new functions (some for libdwarf client code)
and internal logic support for the
DWARF4 .debug_types section.
The new functions are
dwarf_next_cu_header_c(),
dwarf_siblingof_b(), dwarf_offdie_b(),
dwarf_get_cu_die_offset_given_cu_header_offset_b(),
dwarf_get_die_infotypes_flag(),
dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b().
.P
New functions and logic support additional detailed error reporting
so that more compiler bugs can be reported sensibly
by consumer code (as opposed
to having libdwarf just assume
things are ok and blindly continuing on
with erroneous data).
November 20, 2010
.P
It seems impossible to default to both DW_FRAME_CFA_COL
and DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 in a single build of libdwarf,
so the default is now unambiguously DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3
unless the configure option --enable-oldframecol
is specified at configure time.
The function dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value()
may be used to override the default : using that function gives
consumer applications full control (its use is highly
recommended).
(January 17,2010)
.P
Added dwarf_set_reloc_application() and the default
automatic application of Elf 'rela' relocations
to DWARF sections (such rela sections appear in .o files, not
in executables or shared objects, in general).
The  dwarf_set_reloc_application() routine lets a consumer
turn off the automatic application of 'rela' relocations
if desired (it is not clear why anyone would really want to do that,
but possibly a consumer could write its own relocation application).
An example application that traverses a set of DIEs
was added to the new dwarfexample directory (not
in this libdwarf directory, but in parallel to it).
(July 10, 2009)
.P
Added dwarf_get_TAG_name() (and the FORM AT and so on)
interface functions so applications can get the string
of the TAG, Attribute, etc as needed. (June 2009)
.P
Added dwarf_get_ranges_a() and dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
functions which add arguments allowing a correct address_size
when the address_size varies by compilation unit (a varying
address_size is quite rare as of May 2009).
(May 2009)
.P
Added dwarf_set_frame_same_value(), and
dwarf_set_frame_undefined_value() to complete
the set of frame-information functions needed to allow
an application get all frame information
returned correctly (meaning that it
can be correctly interpreted) for all ABIs.
Documented dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value().
Corrected spelling to dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value().
(April 2009).
.P
Added support for various DWARF3 features, but primarily
a new frame-information interface tailorable at run-time
to more than a single ABI.
See dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value(), dwarf_set_frame_rule_table_size(),
dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value().
See also dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3() and
dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3().  (April 2006)
.P
Added support for DWARF3 .debug_pubtypes section.
Corrected various leaks (revising dealloc() calls, adding
new functions) and corrected dwarf_formstring() documentation.
.P
Added dwarf_srclines_dealloc() as the previous deallocation
method documented for data returned by
dwarf_srclines() was incapable of freeing
all the allocated storage (14 July 2005).
.P
dwarf_nextglob(), dwarf_globname(), and dwarf_globdie() were all changed
to operate on the items in the .debug_pubnames section.
.P
All functions were modified to return solely an error code.
Data is returned through pointer arguments.
This makes writing safe and correct library-using-code far easier.
For justification for this approach, see
the chapter titled "Candy Machine Interfaces"
in the book "Writing Solid Code" by
Steve Maguire.

.H 2 "Items Removed"
.P
Dwarf_Type
was removed since types are no longer special.
.P
dwarf_typeof()
was removed since types are no longer special.
.P
Dwarf_Ellist
was removed since element lists no longer are a special format.
.P
Dwarf_Bounds
was removed since bounds have been generalized.
.P
dwarf_nextdie()
was replaced by dwarf_next_cu_header() to reflect the
real way DWARF is organized.
The dwarf_nextdie() was only useful for getting to compilation
unit beginnings, so it does not seem harmful to remove it in favor
of a more direct function.
.P
dwarf_childcnt() is removed on grounds
that no good use was apparent.
.P
dwarf_prevline() and dwarf_nextline() were removed on grounds this
is better left to a debugger to do.
Similarly, dwarf_dieline() was removed.
.P
dwarf_is1stline() was removed as it was not meaningful for the
revised DWARF line operations.
.P
Any libdwarf implementation might well decide to support all the
removed functionality and to retain the DWARF Version 1 meanings
of that functionality.
This would be difficult because the
original libdwarf draft
specification used traditional C library interfaces which
confuse the values returned by successful calls with
exceptional conditions like failures and 'no more data' indications.

.H 1 "Types Definitions"

.H 2 "General Description"
The \fIlibdwarf.h\fP header file contains typedefs and preprocessor
definitions of types and symbolic names used to reference objects
of \fIlibdwarf\fP. The types defined by typedefs contained in
\fIlibdwarf.h\fP all use the convention of adding \f(CWDwarf_\fP
as a prefix and can be placed in three categories:

.BL
.LI
Scalar types : The scalar types defined in \fIlibdwarf.h\fP are
defined primarily for notational convenience and identification.
Depending on the individual definition, they are interpreted as a
value, a pointer, or as a flag.
.LI
Aggregate types : Some values can not be represented by a single
scalar type; they must be represented by a collection of, or as a
union of, scalar and/or aggregate types.
.LI
Opaque types : The complete definition of these types is intentionally
omitted; their use is as handles for query operations, which will yield
either an instance of another opaque type to be used in another query, or
an instance of a scalar or aggregate type, which is the actual result.
.P

.H 2 "Scalar Types"
The following are the defined by \fIlibdwarf.h\fP:

.DS
\f(CW
typedef int                Dwarf_Bool;
typedef unsigned long long Dwarf_Off;
typedef unsigned long long Dwarf_Unsigned;
typedef unsigned short     Dwarf_Half;
typedef unsigned char      Dwarf_Small;
typedef signed long long   Dwarf_Signed;
typedef unsigned long long Dwarf_Addr;
typedef void              *Dwarf_Ptr;
typedef void   (*Dwarf_Handler)(Dwarf_Error error, Dwarf_Ptr errarg);
.DE

.nr aX \n(Fg+1
Dwarf_Ptr is an address for use by the host program calling the library,
not for representing pc-values/addresses within the target object file.
Dwarf_Addr is for pc-values within the target object file.  The sample
scalar type assignments above are for a \fIlibdwarf.h\fP that can read
and write
32-bit or 64-bit binaries on a 32-bit or 64-bit host machine.
The types must be  defined appropriately
for each implementation of libdwarf.
A description of these scalar types in the SGI/MIPS
environment is given in Figure \n(aX.

.H 2 "Aggregate Types"
The following aggregate types are defined by
\fIlibdwarf.h\fP:
\f(CWDwarf_Loc\fP,
\f(CWDwarf_Locdesc\fP,
\f(CWDwarf_Block\fP,
\f(CWDwarf_Frame_Op\fP.
\f(CWDwarf_Regtable\fP.
\f(CWDwarf_Regtable3\fP.
While most of \f(CWlibdwarf\fP acts on or returns simple values or
opaque pointer types, this small set of structures seems useful.
Yet, at the same time, these public structures are inflexible
as any change in format or content
breaks binary (and possibly source in some cases)
compatibility.

.H 3 "Location Record"
The \f(CWDwarf_Loc\fP
type identifies a single atom of a location description
or a location expression.
This is obsolete and should not be used,
though it works adequately for DWARF2.
.DS
\f(CWtypedef struct {
    Dwarf_Small        lr_atom;
    Dwarf_Unsigned     lr_number;
    Dwarf_Unsigned     lr_number2;
    Dwarf_Unsigned     lr_offset;
} Dwarf_Loc;\fP
.DE

The \f(CWlr_atom\fP
identifies the atom corresponding to the 
\f(CWDW_OP_*\fP
definition in \fIdwarf.h\fP
and it represents the operation to be performed
in order to locate the item in question.

.P
The \f(CWlr_number\fP field is the operand
to be used in the calculation
specified by the \f(CWlr_atom\fP
 field; not all atoms use this field.
Some atom operations imply signed numbers
so it is necessary to cast
this to a 
\f(CWDwarf_Signed\fP type for those operations.

.P
The 
\f(CWlr_number2\fP
field is the second operand specified by the
\f(CWlr_atom\fP field; only 
\f(CWDW_OP_BREGX\fP has this field.  Some
atom operations imply signed numbers so
it may be necessary to cast
this to a 
\f(CWDwarf_Signed\fP type for those operations.
.P
For a 
\f(CWDW_OP_implicit_value\fP operator the
\f(CWlr_number2\fP
field is a pointer to the bytes of the value.
The field pointed to
is \f(CWlr_number\fP bytes long.
There is no explicit terminator.
Do not attempt to 
\f(CWfree\fP the bytes which 
\f(CWlr_number2\fP
points at and do not alter those bytes. The pointer value
remains valid till the open Dwarf_Debug is closed.
This is a rather ugly use of a host integer to hold a pointer.
You will normally have to do a 'cast' operation to use the value.
.P
For a 
\f(CWDW_OP_GNU_const_type\fP operator the 
\f(CWlr_number2\fP
field is a pointer to a block with an initial
unsigned byte giving the number of bytes
following, followed immediately that number of const
value bytes.
There is no explicit terminator.
Do not attempt to
\f(CWfree\fP the bytes which 
\f(CWlr_number2\fP
points at and do not alter those bytes.
The pointer value
remains valid till the open Dwarf_Debug is closed.
This is a rather ugly use of a host integer to hold a pointer.
You will normally have to do 
a 'cast' operation to use the value.
.P
The 
\f(CWlr_offset\fP field is the byte offset
(within the block the
location record came from) 
of the atom specified by the \f(CWlr_atom\fP
field.  This is set on all atoms.
This is useful for operations
\f(CWDW_OP_SKIP\fP and 
\f(CWDW_OP_BRA\fP.

.H 3 "Location Description"
This is obsolete and should not be used,
though it works ok for DWARF2..
The
\f(CWDwarf_Locdesc\fP type represents an ordered list of
\f(CWDwarf_Loc\fP records used in the calculation to locate
an item.  Note that in many cases, the location can only be
calculated at runtime of the associated program.

.DS
\f(CWtypedef struct {
    Dwarf_Addr        ld_lopc;
    Dwarf_Addr        ld_hipc;
    Dwarf_Unsigned    ld_cents;
    Dwarf_Loc*        ld_s;
} Dwarf_Locdesc;\fP
.DE

The 
\f(CWld_lopc\fP and 
\f(CWld_hipc\fP fields provide an address range for
which this location descriptor is valid.
Both of these fields are set to
\fIzero\fP if the location descriptor is
valid throughout the scope of the
item it is associated with.
These addresses are virtual memory addresses,
not offsets-from-something.
The virtual memory addresses do not account
for dso movement (none of the pc values from
libdwarf do that, it is up to
the consumer to do that).

.P
The \f(CWld_cents\fP field contains a count
of the number of 
\f(CWDwarf_Loc\fP
entries pointed to by the 
\f(CWld_s\fP field.

.P
The 
\f(CWld_s\fP field points to an array of 
\f(CWDwarf_Loc\fP records.

.H 3 "Data Block"
.SP
This is obsolete and should not be used,
though it works ok for DWARF2.
The \f(CWDwarf_Block\fP type is 
used to contain the value of an attribute
whose form is either 
\f(CWDW_FORM_block1\fP,
\f(CWDW_FORM_block2\fP,
\f(CWDW_FORM_block4\fP, 
\f(CWDW_FORM_block8\fP,
or \f(CWDW_FORM_block\fP.
Its intended use is to deliver the 
value for an attribute of any of these
forms.

.DS
\f(CWtypedef struct {
    Dwarf_Unsigned  bl_len;
    Dwarf_Ptr       bl_data;
    Dwarf_Small     bl_from_loclist;
    Dwarf_Unsigned  bl_section_offset;
} Dwarf_Block;\fP
.DE

.P
The \f(CWbl_len\fP field contains the length in
bytes of the data pointed
to by the \f(CWbl_data\fP field.

.P
The \f(CWbl_data\fP field contains a pointer
to the uninterpreted data.
Since we use  a
\f(CWDwarf_Ptr\fP here one must copy the pointer to
some other type (typically an \f(CWunsigned char
*\fP) so one can add increments to index through
the data.
The data pointed to by \f(CWbl_data\fP
is not necessarily at any useful alignment.

.H 3 "Frame Operation Codes: DWARF 2"
This interface is adequate for DWARF2 but
not entirely suitable for DWARF3 or later.
A new (functional) interface is needed.
This DWARF2 interface is not sufficient
but at present is the only available interface.
.P
See also the section "Low Level Frame Operations" below.
.P
The DWARF2 \f(CWDwarf_Frame_Op\fP type is
used to contain the data of a single
instruction of an instruction-sequence of
low-level information from the
section containing frame information.
This is ordinarily used by
Internal-level Consumers trying to print everything in detail.

.DS
\f(CWtypedef struct {
    Dwarf_Small  fp_base_op;
    Dwarf_Small  fp_extended_op;
    Dwarf_Half   fp_register;
    Dwarf_Signed fp_offset;
    Dwarf_Offset fp_instr_offset;
} Dwarf_Frame_Op;
.DE

\f(CWfp_base_op\fP is the 2-bit basic op code.
\f(CWfp_extended_op\fP is
the 6-bit extended opcode (if
\f(CWfp_base_op\fP indicated there was an
extended op code) and is zero otherwise.
.P
\f(CWfp_register\fP
is any (or the first) register value as defined
in the \f(CWCall frame instruction encodings\fP
in the \f(CWdwarf\fP document
(in DWARF3 see Figure 40,in DWARF5 see table 7.29).
If not used with the operation it is 0.
.P
\f(CWfp_offset\fP
is the address, delta, offset, or second register as defined
in the
\f(CWCall frame instruction encodings\fP
documentation.
If this is an \f(CWaddress\fP then the value should be cast to
\f(CW(Dwarf_Addr)\fP before being used.

In any implementation this field *must* be as large as the
largest of Dwarf_Ptr, Dwarf_Signed, and Dwarf_Addr
for this to work properly.
If not used with the op it is 0.
If the fp_extended_op is
\f(CWDW_CFA_def_cfa\fP
or
\f(CWDW_CFA_val_expression\fP
or
\f(CWDW_CFA_expression\fP
then
\f(CWfp_offset\fP
is a pointer to an expression block in the in-memory
copy of the frame section.
.P
\f(CWfp_instr_offset\fP is the byte_offset (within the instruction
stream of the frame instructions) of this operation.  It starts at 0
for a given frame descriptor.

.H 3 "Frame Regtable: DWARF 2"
This interface is adequate for DWARF2
and MIPS but not for DWARF3 or later.
A separate and preferred interface usable for DWARF3 and for DWARF2
is described below.
See also the section "Low Level Frame Operations" below.
.P
The \f(CWDwarf_Regtable\fP type is used to contain the
register-restore information for all registers at a given
PC value.
Normally used by debuggers.
If you wish to default to this interface and to the use
of DW_FRAME_CFA_COL, specify --enable_oldframecol
at libdwarf configure time.
Or add a call dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value(dbg,DW_FRAME_CFA_COL)
after your dwarf_init_b() call, this call replaces the
default libdwarf-compile-time value with DW_FRAME_CFA_COL.
.DS

} Dwarf_Regtable;\fP
.DE
.P
The array is indexed by register number.
The field values for each index are described next.
For clarity we describe the field values for index rules[M]
(M being any legal array element index).
.P
\f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is non-zero to indicate the
\f(CWdw_offset\fP
field is meaningful.
If zero then the
\f(CWdw_offset\fP is zero
and should be ignored.
.P
\f(CWdw_regnum \fPis the register number applicable.
If \f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is zero, then this is the register
number of the register containing the value for register M.
If \f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is non-zero, then this is
the register number of the register to use as a base (M may be
DW_FRAME_CFA_COL, for example) and the \f(CWdw_offset\fP
value applies.
The value of register M is therefore
the value of register \f(CWdw_regnum\fP.
.P
\f(CWdw_offset\fP should be ignored if
\f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is zero.
If \f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is non-zero, then
the consumer code should add the value to
the value of the register \f(CWdw_regnum\fP to produce the
value.

.H 3 "Frame Operation Codes: DWARF 3 (for DWARF2 and later )"
This interface was intended
to be  adequate for DWARF3 and for DWARF2 (and DWARF4)
but was never implemented.


.H 3 "Frame Regtable: DWARF 3 (for DWARF2 and later)"
This interface is adequate for DWARF2 and later versions.
It is new in libdwarf as of April 2006.
The default configure of libdwarf
inserts DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 as the default CFA column.
Or add a call dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value(dbg,DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3)
after your dwarf_init_b() call, this call replaces the
default libdwarf-compile-time value with DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.
.P
The \f(CWDwarf_Regtable3\fP type is used to contain the
register-restore information for all registers at a given
PC value.
Normally used by debuggers.

.DE
.P
The array is indexed by register number.
The field values for each index are described next.
For clarity we describe the field values for index rules[M]
(M being any legal array element index).
(DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3  DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL, DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL
are not legal array indexes, nor is any index < 0 or >=
rt3_reg_table_size);
The caller  of routines using this
struct must create data space for rt3_reg_table_size entries
of struct Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3_s and arrange that
rt3_rules points to that space and that rt3_reg_table_size
is set correctly.  The caller need not (but may)
initialize the contents of the rt3_cfa_rule or the rt3_rules array.
The following applies to each rt3_rules rule M:
.P
.in +4
\f(CWdw_regnum\fP is the register number applicable.
If \f(CWdw_regnum\fP is DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL, then the
register I has undefined value.
If \f(CWdw_regnum\fP is DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL, then the
register I has the same value as in the previous frame.
.P
If \f(CWdw_regnum\fP is neither of these two,
then the following apply:
.P
.P
\f(CWdw_value_type\fP determines the meaning of the other fields.
It is one of DW_EXPR_OFFSET (0),
DW_EXPR_VAL_OFFSET(1), DW_EXPR_EXPRESSION(2) or
DW_EXPR_VAL_EXPRESSION(3).

.P
If \f(CWdw_value_type\fP is DW_EXPR_OFFSET (0) then
this is as in DWARF2 and the offset(N) rule  or the register(R)
rule
of the DWARF3 and DWARF2 document applies.
The value is either:
.in +4
If \f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is non-zero, then \f(CWdw_regnum\fP
is effectively ignored but must be identical to
DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 (and the \f(CWdw_offset\fP value applies.
The value of register M is therefore
the value of CFA plus the value
of \f(CWdw_offset\fP.   The result of the calculation
is the address in memory where the value of register M resides.
This is the offset(N) rule of the DWARF2 and DWARF3 documents.
.P
\f(CWdw_offset_relevant\fP is zero it indicates the \f(CWdw_offset\fP
field is not meaningful.
The value of register M is
the value currently in register \f(CWdw_regnum\fP (the
value DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 must not appear, only real registers).
This is the register(R) rule of the DWARF3 spec.
.in -4

.P
If \f(CWdw_value_type\fP is DW_EXPR_OFFSET (1) then
this is the the val_offset(N) rule of the DWARF3 spec applies.
The calculation is identical to that of DW_EXPR_OFFSET (0)
but the value is interpreted as the value of register M
(rather than the address where register M's value is stored).
.P
If \f(CWdw_value_type\fP is DW_EXPR_EXPRESSION (2) then
this is the the expression(E) rule of the DWARF3 document.
.P
.in +4
\f(CWdw_offset_or_block_len\fP is the length in bytes of
the in-memory block  pointed at by \f(CWdw_block_ptr\fP.
\f(CWdw_block_ptr\fP is a DWARF expression.
Evaluate that expression and the result is the address
where the previous value of register M is found.
.in -4
.P
If \f(CWdw_value_type\fP is DW_EXPR_VAL_EXPRESSION (3) then
this is the the val_expression(E) rule of the DWARF3 spec.
.P
.in +4
\f(CWdw_offset_or_block_len\fP is the length in bytes of
the in-memory block  pointed at by \f(CWdw_block_ptr\fP.
\f(CWdw_block_ptr\fP is a DWARF expression.
Evaluate that expression and the result is the
previous value of register M.
.in -4
.P
The rule \f(CWrt3_cfa_rule\fP is the current value of
the CFA. It is interpreted exactly like
any register M rule (as described just above) except that
\f(CWdw_regnum\fP cannot be CW_FRAME_CFA_REG3 or
DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL or DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL but must
be a real register number.

.H 3 "Macro Details Record"
The \f(CWDwarf_Macro_Details\fP type gives information about
a single entry in the .debug.macinfo section (DWARF2,
DWARF3, and DWARF4).
It is not useful for DWARF 5 .debug_macro section data.

.P
\f(CWdmd_offset\fP is the byte offset, within the .debug_macinfo
section, of this macro information.
.P
\f(CWdmd_type\fP is the type code of this macro info entry
(or 0, the type code indicating that this is the end of
macro information entries for a compilation unit.
See \f(CWDW_MACINFO_define\fP, etc in the DWARF document.
.P
\f(CWdmd_lineno\fP is the line number where this entry was found,
or 0 if there is no applicable line number.
.P
\f(CWdmd_fileindex\fP is the file index of the file involved.
This is only guaranteed meaningful on a \f(CWDW_MACINFO_start_file\fP
\f(CWdmd_type\fP.  Set to -1 if unknown (see the functional
interface for more details).
.P
\f(CWdmd_macro\fP is the applicable string.
For a \f(CWDW_MACINFO_define\fP
this is the macro name and value.
For a
\f(CWDW_MACINFO_undef\fP, or
this is the macro name.
For a
\f(CWDW_MACINFO_vendor_ext\fP
this is the vendor-defined string value.
For other \f(CWdmd_type\fPs this is 0.

.H 2 "Opaque Types"
The opaque types declared in \fIlibdwarf.h\fP are used as descriptors
for queries against DWARF information stored in various debugging
sections.  Each time an instance of an opaque type is returned as a
result of a \fIlibdwarf\fP operation (\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP excepted),
it should be freed, using \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP when it is no longer
of use (read the following documentation for details, as in at least
one case there is a special routine provided for deallocation
and \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP is not directly called:
see \f(CWdwarf_srclines()\fP).
Some functions return a number of instances of an opaque type
in a block, by means of a pointer to the block
and a count of the number
of opaque descriptors in the block:
see the function description for deallocation
rules for such functions.
The list of opaque types defined in
\fIlibdwarf.h\fP that are pertinent to the
Consumer Library, and their
intended use is described below.
This is not a full list of the opaque types, see libdwarf.h
for the full list.

and is used as a descriptor for queries
about information related to that DIE.  The storage pointed to by this
descriptor should be freed, using

\f(CWtypedef struct Dwarf_Error_s* Dwarf_Error;\fP
.DE
This descriptor points to a structure that provides
detailed information about errors detected by
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP.

\f(CWtypedef struct Dwarf_Cie_s* Dwarf_Cie;\fP
.DE
Instances of \f(CWDwarf_Cie\fP type are returned from
a successful call to the \f(CWdwarf_get_fde_list()\fP

used to extract information from a .gdb_index
section.  This section is a gcc/gdb extension
and is designed to allow a debugger fast access
to data in .debug_info.  The storage pointed to

\f(CWtypedef struct Dwarf_Xu_Index_Header_s* Dwarf_Xu_Index_header;\fP
.DE
Instances of \f(CWDwarf_Xu_Index_Header_s\fP
type are returned from successful calls to the

used to extract information from a .debug_cu_index
or .debug_tu_index section.
These sections are used
to make possible access to .dwo sections gathered
into a .dwp object as part of the DebugFission
(ie Split Dwarf)
project allowing separation of an executable from
most of its DWARF debugging information.
As of May
2015 these sections are accepted into DWARF5 but
the standard has not been released.
The storage
pointed to by this descriptor should be freed using
a call to
\f(CWdwarf_xh_header_free()\fP with a valid
\f(CWDwarf_XuIndexHeader\fP pointer as the argument.

.H 1 "UTF-8 strings"
\fIlibdwarf\fP
is defined, at various points, to return
string pointers or to copy strings into
string areas you define.
DWARF allows the use of
\f(CWDW_AT_use_UTF8\fP
(DWARF3 and later)
\f(CWDW_ATE_UTF\fP
(DWARF4 and later)
to specify that the strings returned are actually
in UTF-8 format.
What this means is that if UTF-8 is specified on
a particular object it is up to callers that wish
to print all the characters properly to use language-appropriate
functions to print Unicode strings appropriately.
All ASCII characters in the strings will print properly
whether printed as wide characters or not.
The methods to convert UTF-8 strings so they will print
correctly for all  such strings
is beyond the scope of this document.
.P
If UTF-8 is not specified then one is probably safe
in assuming the strings are iso_8859-15 and normal
C printf() will work fine..
.P
In either case  one should be wary of corrupted
(accidentally or intentionally)
strings
with ASCII control characters in the text.
Such can cause bad effects if simply printed to a device
(such as a terminal).

.H 1 "Error Handling"
The method for detection and disposition of 
error conditions that arise
during access of debugging information via 
\fIlibdwarf\fP is consistent
across all
\fIlibdwarf\fP
functions that are capable of producing an
error.  This section describes the method used by 
\fIlibdwarf\fP in
notifying client programs of error conditions.
.P
Most functions within
\fIlibdwarf\fP accept as an argument a pointer to
a
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP descriptor where a
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP descriptor
is stored if an error is detected by the function.
Routines in the client
program that provide this argument can query the
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP
descriptor to determine the nature of the error
and perform appropriate
processing.
The intent is that clients do the appropriate processing
immediately on encountering an error and then the client
calls 
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc_error\fP to free the
Dwarf_Error descriptor (at which point the client
should zero that descriptor as the non-zero value is stale).
.P
We think the following is appropriate
as a general outline. See dwarfdump source
for many examples of both of the following
incomplete examples.
The very few functions not following this
general call/return plan are specifically
documented.

.P
In the rare case where the malloc arena is exhausted when
trying to create a Dwarf_Error descriptor a
pointer to a statically allocated
descriptor will be returned.
This static descriptor is new in December 2014.
A call to
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
to free the statically
allocated descriptor is harmless (it sets the error value
in the descriptor to  DW_DLE_FAILSAFE_ERRVAL).
The possible conflation of errors when the arena
is exhausted
(and a dwarf_error descriptor is saved past
the next reader call in any thread)
is considered better than having
\fIlibdwarf\fP
call
\f(CWabort()\fP (as earlier
\fIlibdwarf\fP
did).
.P
We strongly suggest most applications calling
\fIlibdwarf\fP
follow the suggestion above (passing a valid
Dwarf_Error address in the last argument when
calling 
\fIlibdwarf\fP
where there are such
Dwarf_Error arguments) there are other approaches
described just below that might be
worth considering
in small simple applications as they reduce the Dwarf_Error
argument to just passing 0 (null pointer)..
.P
The cases that arise when  passing a null
for the Dwarf_Error and where there
is an error detected are 
A) with an error handler
function  libdwarf will call that function
and on return to 
\fIlibdwarf\fP,
\fIlibdwarf\fP
will
return 
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
to the original client call..
or
B) with no error handler
function (see below) libdwarf will print an error
and call \f(CWabort()\fP.
.P
.AL A
.LI
For the error-handler case
a client program can specify a function to be
invoked upon detection of an error at the time the
library is initialized (see
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP
or 
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP
for example).
When a \fIlibdwarf\fP routine detects an error,
this function is called with two arguments: a code
indicating the nature of the error and a pointer
provided by the client at initialization (again
see
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP
or 
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP).
This pointer argument
can be used to relay information between the error
handler and other routines of the client program.
A client program can specify or change both the
error handling function and the pointer argument
after initialization using
\f(CWdwarf_seterrhand()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_seterrarg()\fP.
When the client error function returns
libdwarf returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
.P
If the client passed in a  non-null
\f(CWerror\fP 
argument in the libdwarf
call finding an error, the
\f(CWdwarf_seterrhand()\fP
function-invocation mentioned here does 
not happen.

.P
.LI
In the  final case, where
\fIlibdwarf\fP
functions are not provided a pointer
to a \f(CWDwarf_Error\fP descriptor,
and no error handling function was
provided at initialization,
\fIlibdwarf\fP functions
print a short message to
\f(CWstdout\fP
and terminate execution with
\f(CWabort()\fP.
.P
Before March 2016
\fIlibdwarf\fP
gave up when there was no error handling
by
emitting a short message on
\f(CWstderr\fP
and
calling \f(CWabort(3C)\fP.
.LE

.P
The following lists the processing steps taken upon detection of an
error:
.AL 1
.LI
Check the \f(CWerror\fP argument; if not a
\fINULL\fP pointer, allocate and initialize a
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP descriptor with information
describing the error, place this descriptor in the
area pointed to by \f(CWerror\fP, and return a value
indicating an error condition.
.LI
If an \f(CWerrhand\fP argument was provided to
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP at initialization, call
\f(CWerrhand()\fP passing it the error descriptor and
the value of the \f(CWerrarg\fP argument provided
to \f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP.  If the error handling
function returns, return \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
indicating an error condition.

.LI
If neither  the \f(CWerror\fP argument nor
an \f(CWerrhand\fP argument was provided
Terminate program execution by calling
\f(CWabort(3C)\fP.
.LE
.SP

In all cases, it is clear from the value returned
from a function that an error occurred in executing
the function, since DW_DLV_ERROR is returned.
.P
As can be seen from the above steps, the
client program can provide an error handler at
initialization, and still provide an \f(CWerror\fP
argument to \fIlibdwarf\fP functions when it is not
desired to have the error handler invoked.

.P
If a \f(CWlibdwarf\fP function is called with
invalid arguments, the behavior is undefined.
In particular, supplying a \f(CWNULL\fP pointer to a
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP function (except where explicitly
permitted), or pointers to invalid addresses or
uninitialized data causes undefined behavior;
the return value in such cases is undefined, and
the function may fail to invoke the caller supplied
error handler or to return a meaningful error number.
Implementations also may abort execution for such
cases.

.P
Some errors are so inconsequential that it does not
warrant rejecting an object or returning an error.
Examples would be a frame length not being a
multiple of an address-size,
an arange in .debug_aranges has some padding
bytes, or a relocation could not be completed.
To make it
possible for a client  to report such errors the
function \f(CWdwarf_get_harmless_error_list\fP
returns strings with error text in them.
This function may be ignored if client code does
not want to bother with such error reporting.

.P
.H 2 "Returned values in the functional interface"
Values returned by \f(CWlibdwarf\fP functions to indicate
success and errors
.nr aX \n(Fg+1
are enumerated in Figure \n(aX.
The \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
case is useful for functions
need to indicate that while there was no data to return
there was no error either.
For example, 
\f(CWdwarf_siblingof()\fP
may return 
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP to indicate that that there was
no sibling to return.

If \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned and a pointer
to a \f(CWDwarf_Error\fP pointer is passed to the
function, then a Dwarf_Error handle is returned
through the pointer. No other pointer value
in the interface returns a value.  After the
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP is no longer of interest, a
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc(dbg,dw_err,DW_DLA_ERROR)\fP on
the error pointer is appropriate to free any space
used by the error information.
.P
If \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is returned no pointer value in the
interface returns a value.
.P
If \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP is returned, the
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP pointer, if supplied, is not
touched, but any other values to be returned through
pointers are returned.
In this case calls (depending
on the exact function returning the error) to
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP may be appropriate once the
particular pointer returned is no longer of interest.

Pointers passed to allow values to be
returned through them are
uniformly the last pointers
in each argument list.
.P
All the interface functions are defined from the
point of view of the writer-of-the-library (as is
traditional for UN*X library documentation), not
from the point of view of the user of the library.

\f(CWDwarf_Line line;
Dwarf_Signed ret_loff;
Dwarf_Error  err;
int retval = dwarf_lineoff(line,&ret_loff,&err);\fP
.DE
for the function defined as
.P
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_lineoff(Dwarf_Line line,
    Dwarf_Signed *return_lineoff,
    Dwarf_Error* err);\fP
.DE
and this document refers to the function as
returning the value through *err or *return_lineoff or
uses the phrase "returns in
the location pointed to by err".
Sometimes other similar phrases are used.

.H 1 "Memory Management"
Several of the functions that comprise \fIlibdwarf\fP
return pointers (opaque descriptors) to structures
that have been dynamically allocated by the
library.  To manage dynamic memory the function
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
is provided to free storage
allocated as a result of a call to a \fIlibdwarf\fP
function.  Some additional functions (described
later) are provided to free storage in particular
circumstances.  This section describes the general
strategy that should be taken by a client program
in managing dynamic storage.
.P
By default 
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
tracks its allocations and
\f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP
cleans up allocations
where 
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
was not called.
See 
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()\fP
below.

.H 2 "Read-only Properties"
All pointers (opaque descriptors) returned by or as a result of a
\fIlibdwarf Consumer Library\fP
call should be assumed to point to read-only memory.
The results are undefined for \fIlibdwarf\fP  clients that attempt
to write to a region pointed to by a value returned by a
\fIlibdwarf Consumer Library\fP
call.

.H 2 "Storage Deallocation"
See the section "Returned values in the functional interface",
above, for the general rules where
calls to \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
are appropriate.
.P
As of May 2020 there are additional dealloc calls
which enable type-checking the calls:
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc_error()\fP,
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc_die()\fP, and
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc_attribute()\fP.
.P
.H 3 "dwarf_dealloc()"
The first prototype is the generic one that can
dealloc any of the libdwarf types, such as DW_DLA_DIE etc..
This has the disadvantages that the 
\f(CWspace_to_dealloc\fP
argument
cannot be type checked and the 
\f(CWappropriate_dla_name\fP
is a simple integer, hence not meaningfully
checkable either.

.P
Whenever possible, use
a type-safe deallocation call
(for several types that is the only
documented deallocation call) 
and for 
\f(CWDwarf_Die\fP
\f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP
or
\f(CWDwarf_Error\fP
use the
following dealloc functions instead
of this one.

(below).

In some cases the pointers returned by a
\fIlibdwarf\fP call are pointers to data which is
not freeable.
The library knows from the allocation
type provided to it whether the space is freeable
or not and will not free inappropriately when
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP is called.
So it is vital
that \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP be called with the
proper allocation type.
.P
For all storage allocated by \fIlibdwarf\fP, the
client can free the storage for reuse by calling
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP, providing it with the
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP descriptor specifying the
object for which the storage was allocated,
a pointer to the area to be free-ed, and an
identifier that specifies what the pointer points
to (the allocation type).
For example, to free
a \f(CWDwarf_Die die\fP belonging the the object
represented by \f(CWDwarf_Debug dbg\fP, allocated
by a call to \f(CWdwarf_siblingof()\fP, the call to
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP would be:
.DS
    \f(CWdwarf_dealloc(dbg, die, DW_DLA_DIE);\fP
    or, preferably,
    \f(CWdwarf_dealloc_die(die);\fP
.DE

To free storage allocated in the
form of a list of pointers (opaque
descriptors), each member of the
list should be deallocated, followed
by deallocation of the actual list itself.  
The following code fragment
uses an invocation of
\f(CWdwarf_attrlist()\fP as an example to illustrate
a technique that can be used to free storage
from any \fIlibdwarf\fP
routine that returns a list:
.in +2

    Dwarf_Signed i = 0;
    int errv = 0;

    errv = dwarf_attrlist(somedie, &atlist,&atcount, &error);
    if (errv == DW_DLV_OK) {
        for (i = 0; i < atcount; ++i) {
            /* use atlist[i] */
            dwarf_dealloc_attribute(atlist[i]);
            /*  This original form still works.
            dwarf_dealloc(dbg, atlist[i], DW_DLA_ATTR);

        dwarf_dealloc(dbg, atlist, DW_DLA_LIST);
    }
}
\fP
.DE
.in -2

\f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP

associated with an instance of a
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP type.
In particular,
it will deallocate all
dynamically allocated space associated with the
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP
descriptor, and finally make the descriptor invalid.

guarantee freeing these last few bytes.
.P
If your application does not care if
a failed libdwarf init function leaks a few
bytes then the September 2020 advice
of calling dwarf_dealloc(dbg,error,DW_DLA_ERROR)
is best, as though leaks a few bytes
with libdwarf before September 2020.
.P
If your application is using 20191104 or earlier
libdwarf  the choice of free(error)
will avoid a leak from a failed
dwarf init call, though changing
to a more recent libdwarf
will then make a few bytes leak quite
possible until the application is changed
to use the dwarf_dealloc call.

.P
.H 1 "Functional Interface"
This section describes the functions available in the \fIlibdwarf\fP
library.  Each function description includes its definition, followed
by one or more paragraph describing the function's operation.

.P
The following sections describe these functions.

.H 2 "Initialization Operations"
These functions are concerned with preparing an object file for subsequent
access by the functions in \fIlibdwarf\fP and with releasing allocated resources when access is complete.
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_init_path_dl()\fP
are the initialization functions
to use if one actually has a path
(if you just have an open fd or 
open libelf handle you cannot
use the _path_ versions  that's fine).
These both allow libdwarf to attempt
to follow 
\f(CWGNU debuglink\fP
hints in a specially produced
executable/shared-object to find
the object file with the DWARF
sections to match tne executable(or
shared-object).
For non-debuglink executables
these two functions behave identically.
.P
\f(CWGNU debuglink\fP
is completely
different than and separate from Split Dwarf
and MacOS dSYM.
it would seem unlikely that these 
could be combined in any 
single executable/shared-object.
All are intended to have DWARF fully
available but not taking space in the
executable/shared object.
See 
https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-Files.html
for information on debuglink and the related build-id.
.P
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP provides
no way
to add extra global paths to debuglink searches.
But
\f(CWdwarf_init_path_dl()\fP
has 2 extra arguments to make adding extra paths
easy.
.P
libdwarf lets one access the executable's
section .eh_frame with frame/backtrace
information by turning off recognition of
\f(CWGNU debuglink\fP in the Dwarf_Debug
being opened by passing in
\f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP
\f(CWtrue_path_bufferlen\fP
as zero.

.H 3 "dwarf_init_path()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_init_path(
    const char *      path,
    char *            true_path_out_buffer,
    unsigned          true_path_bufferlen,
    Dwarf_Unsigned    access,
    unsigned          groupnumber,
    Dwarf_Handler     errhand,
    Dwarf_Ptr         errarg,
    Dwarf_Debug*      dbg,
    const char *      reserved1,
    Dwarf_Unsigned  * reserved2,
    Dwarf_Unsigned  * reserved3,
    Dwarf_Error*    *  error);
.DE
On success the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
and returns a pointer to an initialized
Dwarf_Debug through the dbg argument.
All this work identically across all supported
object file types.
.P
If
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
is returned there is no such
file and nothing else is done or returned.
.P
If
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned
a Dwarf_Error is returned through the error pointer.
and nothing else is done or returned.
.P
Now we turn to the arguments.
.P
Pass in the name of the object file via
the
\f(CWpath\fP
argument.
.P
For MacOS 
pass in a pointer 
to \f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP
big pointing to a buffer
large enough to hold the passed-in
path if that were doubled plus adding 100 characters.
Then pass that length in the
\f(CWtrue_path_bufferlen\fP argument.
If a file is found (the dSYM
path or if not that the original path)
the final path
is copied into
\f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP.
In any case, 
This is harmless with non-MacOS
executables, but for non-MacOS
non
\f(CWGNU_debuglink\fP  objects
\f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP
will just match
\f(CWpath\fP.
.P
For Elf executables/shared-objects
using
\f(CWGNU_debuglink\fP
The same considerations apply:
pass in a pointer
to \f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP
big pointing to a buffer
large enough to hold the passed-in
path if that were doubled plus adding 100 characters
(a heuristic)
(the 100 is arbitrary: 
\f(CWGNU_debuglink\fP paths can be
long but not likely longer than this
suggested size.

.P
When
you know you won't be
reading MacOS executables
and won't be accessing
\f(CWGNU_debuglink\fP
executables
special treatment
by passing 0 as arguments to
\f(CWtrue_path_out_buffer\fP
and
\f(CWtrue_path_bufferlen\fP.
If those are zero the
\f(CWMacOS\fP/
\f(CWGNU_debuglink\fP
special processing will not occur.

.P
Pass in zero with the
\f(CWaccess\fP
\f(CW
\fP
argument.
The 
\f(CWDW_DLC_READ\fP
flag,
which only ever applied to libelf,
is zero.

.P
The
\f(CWgroupnumber\fP argument indicates which group is to
be accessed Group one is normal dwarf sections such as
\f(CW.debug_info\fP.
Group two is DWARF5 dwo split-dwarf dwarf
sections such as .debug_info.dwo.

Groups three and higher are for COMDAT groups.  If an object
file has only sections from one of the groups then passing
zero will access that group.  Otherwise passing zero will
access only group one.

See
\f(CWdwarf_sec_group_sizes()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_sec_group_map()\fP
for more group information.

Typically
pass in DW_GROUPNUMBER_ANY
to
\f(CWgroupnumber\fP.
Non-elf objects do not use
this field.
.P
The \f(CWerrhand\fP
argument is a pointer to a function that will be
invoked whenever an error is detected as a result of
a \fIlibdwarf\fP operation.  The \f(CWerrarg\fP
argument is passed as an argument to the
\f(CWerrhand\fP function.
.P
\f(CWdbg\fP
is used to return an initialized Dwarf_Debug pointer.
.P
\f(CWreserved1\fP,
\f(CWreserved2\fP,
and
\f(CWreserved3\fP
are currently unused, pass 0
in to all three.
.P
Pass in a pointer
to a Dwarf_Error to the
\f(CWerror\fP
argument
if you wish libdwarf to return an
error code.

.H 3 "dwarf_init_path_dl()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_init_path_dl(
    const char *      path,
    char *            true_path_out_buffer,

    Dwarf_Unsigned  * reserved3,
    Dwarf_Error*    *  error);
\fP
.DE
This function is identical to
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP
in every respect except if you
know that you must use special paths
to find the
\f(CWGNU debuglink\fP
target file with DWARF information.
.P
\f(CWglobal_paths\fP
allows you to specify such paths.
Pass in
\f(CWglobal_paths\fP
as a pointer to an array of 
pointer-to-char, each
pointing to a global path string.
Pass in 
\f(CWglobal_paths_count\fP
with the number of entries in the
pointer array.
Pass both as zero if there are
no debuglink global paths
other than the default standard
\f(CW/usr/lib/debug\fP.

.H 3 "dwarf_init_b()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_init_b(
int fd,
    Dwarf_Unsigned access,
    unsigned group_number,
    Dwarf_Handler errhand,
    Dwarf_Ptr errarg,
    Dwarf_Debug * dbg,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
the function \f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP returns through
\f(CWdbg\fP a \f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP descriptor
that represents a handle for accessing
debugging records associated with
the open file descriptor \f(CWfd\fP.
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is returned if the object
does not contain DWARF debugging information.
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned if
an error occurred.
.P
The
\f(CWaccess\fP argument indicates what access is
allowed for the section.
The \f(CWDW_DLC_READ\fP macro value
is zero and
valid for read access (only read access
is defined or discussed in this document).
No value other than zero should be passed
in to these consumer/reader functions.
The value passed in is ignored.
.P
The
\f(CWgroupnumber\fP argument indicates which group is to
be accessed Group one is normal dwarf sections such as
\f(CW.debug_info\fP.  Group two is DWARF5 dwo split-dwarf dwarf
sections such as .debug_info.dwo.

Groups three and higher are for COMDAT groups.  If an object
file has only sections from one of the groups then passing
zero will access that group.  Otherwise passing zero will
access only group one.

See
\f(CWdwarf_sec_group_sizes()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_sec_group_map()\fP
for more group information.

.P
The \f(CWerrhand\fP
argument is a pointer to a function that will be
invoked whenever an error is detected as a result of
a \fIlibdwarf\fP operation.  The \f(CWerrarg\fP
argument is passed as an argument to the
\f(CWerrhand\fP function.
.P
The file descriptor associated with the \f(CWfd\fP
argument must refer to an ordinary file (i.e. not a
pipe, socket, device, /proc entry, etc.), be opened
with the at least as much permission as specified by
the \f(CWaccess\fP argument, and cannot be closed or
used as an argument to any system calls by the client
until after \f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP is called.  The
seek position of the file associated with \f(CWfd\fP
is undefined upon return of \f(CWdwarf_init()\fP.
.P
Historical Note:
With SGI IRIX, by default it was allowed that
the app \f(CWclose()\fP \f(CWfd\fP immediately
after calling \f(CWdwarf_init()\fP, but that
is not  a portable approach (that it worked was an
accidental side effect of the fact that SGI IRIX used
\f(CWELF_C_READ_MMAP\fP in its hidden internal call
to \f(CWelf_begin()\fP).
The portable approach is to
consider that \f(CWfd\fP must be left open till after
the corresponding dwarf_finish() call has returned.
.P
Since \f(CWdwarf_init()\fP uses the same error
handling processing as other \fIlibdwarf\fP functions
(see \fIError Handling\fP above), client programs
will generally supply an \f(CWerror\fP parameter
to bypass the default actions during initialization
unless the default actions are appropriate.

.H 3 "dwarf_init()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_init(
    int fd,
    Dwarf_Unsigned access,
    Dwarf_Handler errhand,
    Dwarf_Ptr errarg,
    Dwarf_Debug * dbg,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
\f(CWdwarf_init()\fP
is identical to
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP
except that 
\f(CWdwarf_init()\fP
is missing the groupnumber
argument so access to an object file containing
both dwo and non-dwo DWARF5 object sections will
access only group one (and will ignore the dwo sections).
.P
The \f(CWdwarf_get_elf()\fP
function 
cannot succeed when using
\f(CWdwarf_init()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_init_path()\fP
to
open an object file.

.H 3 "dwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_set_de_alloc_flag(
    int v)\fP
.DE
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()\fP
sets and returns a flag value
applying to the current running instance
of
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP.
It's action sets an internal value,
and that value should be set/changed
(if you wish to do that) before any
other
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
calls.
.P
By default
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP keeps track of all its
internal allocations.
So if the documentation here says you should
do 
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
calls 
(or other calls documented here
for specific functions) and you omit
some or all of them then
calling
\f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP
will clean up all those allocations
left undone.
.P
If you call
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag(0)\fP
then libdwarf will not keep track
of allocations so your code must do
all
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP calls
as defined below.
.P
If you call
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag(1)\fP
that sets/restores the setting to
its default value so from that point
all new internal allocations will be
tracked and
\f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP
can clean the new ones up.
.P
The return value of
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()\fP
is the previous value of the internal flag:
One (1) is the default, meaning record allocations..
Zero (0) is the other possible value, meaning
do not record 
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
allocations.
.P
It is best to ignore this call unless you
have gigantic DWARF sections and you need
whatever percent speed improvement
from
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
that you can get.
If you do use it
then by all means use tools such as cc --fsanitize...
or valgrind to ensure there are no leaks in your
application (at least given your test cases).
.P
The function name echos the spelling of a 
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP-internal
field in 
\f(CWstruct Dwarf_Debug_s\fP
named 
\f(CWde_alloc_tree\fP.

.H 3 "Dwarf_Handler function"
This is an example of a valid error handler function.
A pointer to this  (or another like it)
may be passed to
\f(CWdwarf_elf_init_b()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_init_b()\fP.
.DS
\f(CWstatic void
simple_error_handler(Dwarf_Error error, Dwarf_Ptr errarg)
{
    printf("libdwarf error: %d  %s\\n",
        dwarf_errno(error), dwarf_errmsg(error));
    exit(1);
}\fP
.DE
.P
This will only be called if an error is detected inside libdwarf
and the
Dwarf_Error
argument passed to libdwarf is NULL.
A Dwarf_Error will be created with the error number
assigned by the library and passed to the error handler.
.P
The second argument is a copy of the value passed in to
\f(CWdwarf_elf_init_b()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_init()\fP
as the
\f(CWerrarg()\fP argument.
Typically the init function would be passed
a pointer to an application-created struct
containing the data the application needs to
do what it wants to do in the error handler.
.P
In a language with exceptions or exception-like features
an exception could be thrown here.
Or the application could simply give up and call
\f(CWexit()\fP
as in the sample given above.

.P
The function

an open \f(CWElf *\fP pointer is passed instead of a file
descriptor so
\f(CWdwarf_get_elf()\fP
can succeed.
.P
The client is allowed to use the 
\f(CWElf *\fP pointer
for its own purposes without restriction during the time the
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP

.DE
The function 
\f(CWdwarf_elf_init()\fP is identical to

.P
The function \f(CWdwarf_get_elf()\fP
is only meaningful if a
\f(CWdwarf_elf_init[_b]()\fP
function was used to initialize the pointer 
\f(CWdbg\fP.
None of the other dwarf*init*() functions here
ever use libelf, so
there is no elf pointer to return through
the pointer, so
and the call will return
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.
In addition,
this function is also not meaningful for an object file
that is not in the Elf format.
.P
When it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
the function \f(CWdwarf_get_elf()\fP returns through the
pointer \f(CWelf\fP the \f(CWElf *\fP handle
used to access the object represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP

\f(CWDW_FORM_addrx\fP

\f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP releases all \fILibdwarf\fP internal resources
associated with the descriptor \f(CWdbg\fP, and invalidates \f(CWdbg\fP.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP if there is an error during the
finishing operation.  It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
for a successful operation.

Because \f(CWint dwarf_init()\fP opens an Elf descriptor
on its fd and \f(CWdwarf_finish()\fP does not close that
descriptor, an app should use \f(CWdwarf_get_elf\fP
and should call \f(CWelf_end\fP with the pointer returned
through the \f(CWElf**\fP handle created by \f(CWint dwarf_init()\fP.

.H 3 "dwarf_set_stringcheck()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_set_stringcheck(
        int stringcheck)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWint dwarf_set_stringcheck()\fP sets a global flag
and returns the previous value of the global flag.

If the stringcheck global flag is zero (the default)
libdwarf does string length validity checks
(the checks do slow libdwarf down very slightly).
If the stringcheck global flag is non-zero
libdwarf does not do string length validity
checks.

The global flag is really just 8 bits long, upperbits are not noticed
or recorded.


.H 3 "dwarf_set_reloc_application()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_set_reloc_application(
        int apply)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWint dwarf_set_reloc_application()\fP sets a global flag
and returns the previous value of the global flag.

If the reloc_application global flag is non-zero (the default)
then the applicable .rela section (if one exists) will be
processed and applied to any DWARF section when it is read in.
If the reloc_application global flag is zero no such
relocation-application is attempted.

Not all
machine types (elf header e_machine)
or all relocations are supported, but then very few
relocation types apply to DWARF debug sections.

The global flag is really just 8 bits long, upperbits are not noticed
or recorded.

It seems unlikely anyone will need to call this function.

.H 3 "dwarf_record_cmdline_options()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_record_cmdline_options(
    Dwarf_Cmdline_Options options)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWint dwarf_record_cmdline_options()\fP
copies a Dwarf_Cmdline_Options structure from
consumer code to libdwarf.

The structure is defined in \f(CWlibdwarf.h\fP.

The initial version of this structure has a single field
\f(CWcheck_verbose_mode\fP which, if non-zero, tells
libdwarf to print some detailed messages to 
\f(CWstdout\fP
in case
certain errors are detected.

The default for this value is FALSE (0) so the extra messages
are off by default.

    Dwarf_Debug*  dbg,
    Dwarf_Error*  error)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWint dwarf_object_init_b()\fP
enables access to non-Elf object files
by allowing the caller to
then provide
function pointers to code (user-written,
not part of libdwarf)  that will
look, to libdwarf, as if libdwarf was
reading Elf.
.P
See
\f(CWint dwarf_init_b()\fP
for additional information on the arguments
passed in (the
\f(CWobj\fP argument here
is a set of function pointers
and describing how to access non-Elf
files is beyond the scope of this document.
.P
As a hint, note that the source files with
dwarf_elf_init_file_ownership() (dwarf_original_elf_init.c)
and
dwarf_elf_object_access_init() (dwarf_elf_access.c)
are the only sources that would need replacement
for a different object format.
The replacement would need to emulate certain
conventions of Elf objects, (mainly that
section index
0 is an empty section) but the rest of
libdwarf uses what these two source files set up
without knowing how to operate on Elf.

.P
Writing the functions needed to support
non-Elf will require study of Elf
and of the object format involved.
The topic is beyond the scope of
this document.

.DE
The function
\f(CWint dwarf_object_init()\fP

.DE
Elf sections are sometimes compressed to reduce the disk
footprint of the sections.
It's sometimes interesting to library users
what the real name was in the object file and whether it
was compressed.  Libdwarf uncompresses such sections
automatically.
It's not usually necessary to know the true name or
anything about compression.
.P
\f(CW
\fP
The caller passes in a
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP
pointer
and a standard section name such as ".debug_info" .
On success the function returns (through the
other arguments) the true section name and a
flag which, if non-zero means the section was compressed
and a flag which, if non-zero means the section had
the Elf section flag SHF_COMPRESSED set.
The caller must ensure that the memory pointed to
by
\f(CWactual_sec_name_out\fP,
\f(CWmarked_zcompressed\fP, and
\f(CWmarked_zlib_compressed\fP,
\f(CWmarked_shf_compressed\fP,
\f(CWcompressed_length\fP,
\f(CWuncompressed_length\fP,
is zero at the point of call.
.P
The flag
\f(CW*marked_compressed\fP,
if non-zero,
means the section name started
with .zdebug (indicating compression
was done).
.P
The flag
\f(CWmarked_zlib_compressed\fP,
if non-zero means the
initial bytes of the section starte
with the ASCII characters ZLIB
and the section was compressed.
.P
The flag
\f(CWmarked_shf_compressed\fP
if non-zero means the Elf section
sh_flag SHF_COMPRESSED is set
and the section was compressed..
The flag value in an elf section
header is (1<<11) (0x800).
.P
The value
\f(CWcompressed_length\fP
is passed back through the pointer
if and only if the section is compressed
and the pointer is non-null.
.P
The value
\f(CWuncompressed_length\fP
is passed back through the pointer
if and only if the section is compressed
and the pointer is non-null.
.P
If the section name passed in is not used by libdwarf
for this object file
the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
.P
On error the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
.P
The string pointed to by
\f(CW*actual_sec_name_out\fP
must not be free()d.

.H 3 "dwarf_package_version()"
.DS
\f(CWconst char * dwarf_package_version(void); \fP
.DE
The package version is set in config.h (from
its value in configure.ac and in CMakeLists.txt
in the source tree) at the 
build time of the library.
A pointer to a static string is returned by this
function.
The format is standard ISO date format. 
For example "20180718".
It's not entirely clear how this actually helps.
But there is a request for this and we provide it
as of 23 October 2019.

.H 2 "Object Type Detectors"
These are used by
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
and may be of use generally.
They have no connection to
any Dwarf_Debug data as you see
from the arguments passed in.
.H 3 "dwarf_object_detector_path()"

    Dwarf_Unsigned  *filesize,
    int * errcode);\fP
.DE
On success the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
and returns various data through the
arguments (described just below).
This works identically across all supported
object file types.
.P
If
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
is returned there is no such
file and nothing else is done or returned.
.P
If
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned
a Dwarf_Error is returned through the error pointer.
and nothing else is done or returned.
.P
Now we turn to the arguments.
Pass in the name of the object file via
the
\f(CWpath\fP
argument.
.P
To
\f(CWoutpath\fP
pass in a pointer big enough to hold the passed-in
path if that were doubled plus adding 100 characters.
Then pass that length in the
\f(CWoutpath_len\fP argument.
The path will be copied to outpath.
In the case of certain MacOS dSYM
object files the final outpath
of the dSYM file (with MacOS conventional
directories added) is copied into
\f(CWoutpath\fP. Where the MacOS
local directory tree is missing
or incomplete
\f(CWoutpath\fP
will be left as a zero-lengh string.
.P
To entirely skip the MacOS special treatment
pass 0 as arguments to
\f(CWoutpath\fP
and
\f(CWoutpath_len\fP.
.P
The \f(CWftype\fP
pointer argument returns
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_ELF\fP,
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_MACH_O\fP
,
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_PE\fP
,
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_ARCHIVE\fP
or
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_UNKNOWN\fP
to the caller.
The
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_ARCHIVE\fP
value says nothing whatever
about the contents of the
archive.
.P
The \f(CWendian\fP
pointer argument returns
\f(CWDW_ENDIAN_BIG\fP,
\f(CWDW_ENDIAN_LITTLE\fP
,
\f(CWDW_ENDIAN_SAME\fP
,
\f(CWDW_ENDIAN_OPPOSITE\fP
or
\f(CWDW_ENDIAN_UNKNOWN\fP
to the caller.
.P
The \f(CWoffsetsize\fP
pointer argument returns
a size value from the object file.
If the object file uses 32-bit
offsets it returns 32, and if
64-bit offsets it returns 64.
Each object type uses such values
but the ways the value is used
varies.
.P
The \f(CWfilesize\fP
pointer argument returns
the size, in bytes, of the object file.
This is essentially useless for
\f(CWDW_FTYPE_ARCHIVE\fP
files, one thinks.
.P
The \f(CWerrcode\fP
pointer argument returns
(if and only if DW_DLV_ERROR is returned
by the function) an integer error code.
At this time there is no handy function
to turn that error code into a string.
In the libdwarf source you will find that code in
the DW_DLE_* error list.

.DE
\f(CWdwarf_object_detector_fd()\fP
is the same as
\f(CWdwarf_object_detector_path()\fP
except that no path strings apply to
\f(CWdwarf_object_detector_fd()\fP.


.H 2 "Section Group Operations"
The section group data is essential information
when processing an object with COMDAT section group DWARF sections
or with both split-dwarf (.dwo sections)
and non-split dwarf sections.
.P
It relies on Elf section groups, whereas some compilers
rely instead on relocation information to identify
section groups.
These relocation-specified groupings are not understood
at this time.
.P
A standard DWARF2 or DWARF3 or DWARF4 object
(Old Standard Object, or OSO) will
not contain any of those new sections.
The DWARF4 standard, Appendix E.1 "Using Compilation Units"
offers an overview of COMDAT section groups.
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
assigns  the group number one(1) to
OSO DWARF.
Any sections that are split dwarf (section name ending in .dwo
or one of the two special DWP index sections)
are assigned group number two(2)
by libdwarf.
COMDAT section groups are assigned groups numbers 3 and higher as needed.
.P
The COMDAT section group uses are not well defined, but
popular compilations systems are using such sections.
There is no meaningful documentation
that we can find (so far) on how the COMDAT
section groups are used,
so
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
is based on observations
of what compilers generate.

\f(CWlibdwarf\fP.
.P
The
\f(CW*group_count_out\fP
is set to the number of groups
in the object (as
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP
counts them).
An OSO will have exactly one group.
A DWP object will have exactly one group.
If is more than one group consumer code
will likely want to open additional
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP
objects and request
relevant information to process the
DWARF contents.
An executable or a DWP object will
always have a
\f(CW*group_count_out\fP
of one(1).
An executable or a shared library
cannot have any COMDAT section groups
as the linker will have dealt with them.
.P
The

This is new in August 2013.
.P
The \f(CWdwarf_print_lines()\fP function
is intended as a helper to programs like \f(CWdwarfdump\fP
and show some line internal details in a way only
the internals
of libdwarf can show them.
But using printf directly in libdwarf means the caller
has limited control of where the output appears.
So now the 'printf' output is passed back to the
caller through a callback function whose implementation
is provided by the caller.
.P
Any code calling libdwarf can ignore
the functions described in this section completely.
If the functions are ignored the messages
(if any) from libdwarf will simply not appear anywhere.
.P
The \f(CWlibdwarf.h\fP header file defines
\f(CWstruct Dwarf_Printf_Callback_Info_s\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_register_printf_callback\fP
for those libdwarf callers wishing to implement the callback.
In this section we describe how one uses that interface.

The field \f(CWdp_user_pointer\fP is remembered by libdwarf

The field \f(CWdp_fptr\fP is either NULL or a pointer to

If the field \f(CWdp_buffer_user_provided\fP is non-zero
then \f(CWdp_buffer_len\fP and \f(CWdp_buffer\fP

without doing any malloc of space.
If the field \f(CWdp_buffer_user_provided\fP is zero
then the input fields \f(CWdp_buffer_len\fP and \f(CWdp_buffer\fP
are ignored by libdwarf and space is malloc'd as needed.
.P
The field \f(CWdp_reserved\fP is ignored, it is reserved for
future use.

.P
Any application using the callbacks needs to use the function
\f(CWdwarf_register_printf_callback()\fP and supply a function matching
the above function prototype from libdwarf.h.

.H 3 "Example of printf callback use in a C++ application using libdwarf"
.DS
\f(CWstruct Dwarf_Printf_Callback_Info_s printfcallbackdata;

Assuming the user implements something
like the following function in her application:

.P
It is crucial that the user's callback function copies or
prints the data immediately. Once the user callback
function returns the \f(CWdata\fP
pointer may change or become stale without warning.


.H 2 "Debugging Information Entry Delivery Operations"
These functions are concerned with accessing debugging information

Since all such sections use similar formats, one
set of functions suffices.

\f(CWdwarf_get_die_section_name()\fP lets consumers
access the object section name when no specific
DIE is at hand.
This is useful for applications wanting to print
the name, but of course the object section name is not
really a part of the DWARF information.
Most applications will
probably not call this function.
It can be called at any time
after the Dwarf_Debug initialization is done.
See  also \f(CWdwarf_get_die_section_name_b()\fP.
.P
The function
\f(CWdwarf_get_die_section_name()\fP operates on
the either the .debug_info[.dwo] section
(if \f(CWis_info\fP is non-zero)
or .debug_types[.dwo]
section
(if \f(CWis_info\fP is zero).
.P
If the function succeeds, \f(CW*sec_name\fP is set to
a pointer to a string with the object section name and
the function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP.
Do not free the string whose pointer is returned.
For non-Elf objects it is possible the string pointer
returned will be NULL or will point to an empty string.
It is up to the calling application to recognize this
possibility and deal with it appropriately.
.P
If the section does not exist the function returns
DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY.
.P
If there is an internal error detected the
function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP and sets the
\f(CW*error\fP pointer.

    Dwarf_Unsigned *next_cu_header,
    Dwarf_Half     *header_cu_type,
    Dwarf_Error    *error);
.DE
The function
\f(CWdwarf_next_cu_header_d()\fP operates on
the either the .debug_info   section
(if \f(CWis_info\fP is non-zero) or .debug_types
section
(if \f(CWis_info\fP is zero).
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
if it fails, and
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP if it succeeds.
.P
If it succeeds, \f(CW*next_cu_header\fP is set to
the offset in the .debug_info section of the next
compilation-unit header if it succeeds.  On reading the last
compilation-unit header in the .debug_info section it contains
the size of the .debug_info or debug_types section.
Beginning 22 April 2019
\f(CWnext_cu_header\fP
will not be used to return the offset
if 
\f(CWnext_cu_header\fP
is null.
Be cautious using a null argument
unless you know that only a suitably
recent version of libdwarf will be used.

.P
The next call to
\f(CWdwarf_next_cu_header_b()\fP returns \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
without reading a
compilation-unit or setting \f(CW*next_cu_header\fP.
Subsequent calls to \f(CWdwarf_next_cu_header()\fP
repeat the cycle by reading the first compilation-unit and so on.
.P
The other
values returned through pointers are the values in the compilation-unit
header.  If any of \f(CWcu_header_length\fP, 
\f(CWversion_stamp\fP,
\f(CWabbrev_offset\fP, \f(CWaddress_size\fP,
\f(CWoffset_size\fP, \f(CWextension_size\fP,
\f(CWsignature\fP, or \f(CWtypeoffset\fP,
is \f(CWNULL\fP, the
argument is ignored (meaning it is not an error to provide a
\f(CWNULL\fP pointer for any or all of these arguments).
.P
\f(CWcu_header_length\fP returns the length in bytes of the compilation
unit header.
.P
\f(CWversion_stamp\fP returns the section version, which
would be (for .debug_info) 2 for DWARF2, 3 for DWARF3,
4 for DWARF4, or 5 for DWARF5..
.P
\f(CWabbrev_offset\fP returns the .debug_abbrev
section offset of the abbreviations
for this compilation unit.
.P
\f(CWaddress_size\fP returns the size of an address in this
compilation unit.  Which is usually 4 or 8.
.P
\f(CWoffset_size\fP returns the size in bytes of
an offset for the compilation unit.  The offset size
is 4 for 32bit dwarf
and 8 for 64bit dwarf.
This is the offset size in dwarf data, not
the address size inside the executable code.
The offset size can be 4 even
if embedded in a 64bit elf file (which
is normal for 64bit elf), and can be 8 even in
a 32bit elf file (which probably will never be seen
in practice).
.P
The
\f(CWextension_size\fP pointer is only relevant if
the \f(CWoffset_size\fP pointer returns 8.
The value is not normally useful but is returned
through the pointer for completeness.
The pointer \f(CWextension_size\fP returns 0
if the CU is MIPS/IRIX non-standard 64bit dwarf
(MIPS/IRIX 64bit dwarf was created years before DWARF3
defined 64bit dwarf)
and returns 4 if the dwarf uses the standard 64bit
extension (the 4 is the size in bytes of the 0xffffffff
in the initial length field
which indicates the following 8 bytes in the .debug_info section
are the real length).
See the DWARF3 or DWARF4 standard, section 7.4.
.P
The
\f(CWsignature\fP pointer is only relevant if
 the CU has a type signature, and if relevant the 8 byte type
signature of the .debug_types CU header is assigned through
the pointer.
.P
The
\f(CWtypeoffset\fP pointer is only relevant
the CU has a type signature
if relevant the local offset
within the CU of the the type offset the .debug_types entry
represents is assigned through the pointer.
The
\f(CWtypeoffset\fP matters because a
DW_AT_type referencing the type unit may reference an inner type,
such as a  C++ class in a C++ namespace, but the type itself
has the enclosing namespace in the .debug_type type_unit.
.P
The
\f(CWheader_cu_type\fP pointer is applicable to
all  CU headers.
The value returned through the pointer is either
\f(CWDW_UT_compile\fP
\f(CWDW_UT_partial\fP
\f(CWDW_UT_type\fP
and identifies the header type of this CU.
In \f(CWDWARF4\fP a \f(CWDW_UT_type\fP
will be in \f(CW.debug_types\fP, but in
\f(CWDWARF5\fP these compilation units are in \f(CW.debug_info\fP
and the Debug Fission (ie Split Dwarf) \f(CW.debug_info.dwo\fP
sections .

If \f(CWis_info\fP is non-zero then the  \f(CWdie\fP

If \f(CWis_info\fP is zero then the  \f(CWdie\fP
is assumed to refer to a .debug_types DIE.
Note that the first call (the call that gets the compilation-unit
DIE in a compilation unit) passes in a NULL \f(CWdie\fP
so having the caller pass in \f(CWis_info\fP is essential.
And if \f(CWdie\fP is non-NULL it is still essential for the

When used correctly in a depth-first walk of a DIE tree this
function validates that any DW_AT_sibling attribute gives
the same offset as the direct tree walk.
That is the only purpose of this function.

The function \f(CWdwarf_validate_die_sibling()\fP
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP  if the last die processed
in a depth-first DIE tree walk was the same offset as
generated by a call to \f(CWdwarf_siblingof()\fP.
Meaning that the DW_AT_sibling attribute value, if any, was correct.

If the conditions are not met then DW_DLV_ERROR is returned
and  \f(CW*offset\fP is set to the offset
in the .debug_info section of the last DIE processed.
If the application prints the offset a knowledgeable
user may be able to figure out what the compiler did wrong.

.H 2 "Debugging Information Entry Query Operations"
These queries return specific information about debugging information

given a \f(CWDwarf_Die\fP descriptor.  Note that some operations are
specific to debugging information entries that are represented by a
\f(CWDwarf_Die\fP descriptor of a specific type.
For example, not all
debugging information entries contain an attribute having a name, so
consequently, a call to \f(CWdwarf_diename()\fP using a \f(CWDwarf_Die\fP
descriptor that does not have a name attribute will return
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.
This is not an error, i.e. calling a function that needs a specific
attribute is not an error for a die that does not contain that specific
attribute.
.P
There are several methods that can be used to obtain the value of an
attribute in a given die:
.AL 1
.LI
Call \f(CWdwarf_hasattr()\fP to determine if the debugging information
entry has the attribute of interest prior to issuing the query for
information about the attribute.

.LI
Supply an \f(CWerror\fP argument, and check its value after the call to
a query indicates an unsuccessful return, to determine the nature of the
problem.  The \f(CWerror\fP argument will indicate whether an error occurred,
or the specific attribute needed was missing in that die.

.LI
Arrange to have an error handling function invoked upon detection of an
error (see \f(CWdwarf_init()\fP).

.LI
Call \f(CWdwarf_attrlist()\fP and iterate through the returned list of
attributes, dealing with each one as appropriate.

the function \f(CWdwarf_dieoffset()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_offset\fP
to the position of \f(CWdie\fP
in the section containing debugging information entries
(the \f(CWreturn_offset\fP is a section-relative offset).
In other words,
it sets \f(CWreturn_offset\fP
to the offset of the start of the debugging information entry
described by \f(CWdie\fP in the section containing dies i.e .debug_info.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.


.H 3 "dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed()"
\f(CWdwarf_addr_form_is_indexed(form)\fP
is a utility function to make it simple to determine
if a form is one of the indexed forms (there are
several such in DWARF5).
See DWARF5 section 7.5.5  \f(CWClasses and Forms\fP
for more information.
.DS
int dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed(Dwarf_Half form);
.DE
It returns TRUE if the form is one of the
indexed address forms (such as DW_FORM_addrx1)
and FALSE otherwise.

.H 3 "dwarf_debug_addr_index_to_addr()"
.DS
int dwarf_debug_addr_index_to_addr(Dwarf_Die /*die*/,
    Dwarf_Unsigned  index,
    Dwarf_Addr    * return_addr,
    Dwarf_Error   * error);
.DE
Attributes with form DW_FORM_addrx, the
operation DW_OP_addrx, or
certain of the split-dwarf location list entries
give an index value to
a machine address in the .debug_addr section
(which is always in .debug_addr even when
the form/operation are in a split dwarf .dwo section).
.P
On successful return this function turns such an index
into a target address value through the pointer
\f(CWreturn_addr\fP .
.P
If there is an error this may return DW_
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP and it will have
returned an error through \f(CW*error\fP.
.P
If there is no available .debug_addr section this
may return \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_die_CU_offset(
    Dwarf_Die die,
    Dwarf_Off *return_offset,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_die_CU_offset()\fP is similar to
\f(CWdwarf_dieoffset()\fP, except that it puts the offset of the DIE
represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Die\fP \f(CWdie\fP, from the
start of the compilation-unit that it belongs to rather than the start
of .debug_info (the \f(CWreturn_offset\fP is a CU-relative offset).

.H 3 "dwarf_die_offsets()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_die_offsets(
    Dwarf_Die die,
    Dwarf_Off *global_off,
    Dwarf_Off *cu_off,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_die_offsets()\fP is a combination of
\f(CWdwarf_dieoffset()\fP and \f(CWdwarf_die_cu_offset()\fP
in that it returns both the global .debug_info offset and
the CU-relative offset of the \f(CWdie\fP in a single call.

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_ptr_CU_offset(
    Dwarf_CU_Context cu_context,
    Dwarf_Byte_ptr di_ptr ,
    Dwarf_Off *cu_off)\fP
.DE
Given a valid CU context pointer and a pointer into that CU
context,
the function \f(CWdwarf_ptr_CU_offset()\fP returns DW_DLV_OK
and sets \f(CW*cu_off\fP to the CU-relative (local) offset
in that CU.


.H 3 "dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die(
    Dwarf_Die given_die,
    Dwarf_Off *return_offset,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die()\fP is similar to
\f(CWdwarf_die_CU_offset()\fP, except that it puts the
global offset of the CU DIE owning \f(CWgiven_die\fP
of .debug_info (the \f(CWreturn_offset\fP is a global section offset).
.P
This is useful when processing a DIE tree and encountering
an error or other surprise in a DIE, as the \f(CWreturn_offset\fP
can be passed to \f(CWdwarf_offdie_b()\fP to return a pointer
to the CU die of the CU owning the \f(CWgiven_die\fP passed
to \f(CWdwarf_CU_dieoffset_given_die()\fP. The consumer can
extract information from the CU die and the \f(CWgiven_die\fP
(in the normal way) and print it.

An example  (a snippet) of code using this function
follows. It assumes that \f(CWin_die\fP is a DIE
in .debug_info
that, for some reason, you have decided needs CU context
printed (assuming \f(CWprint_die_data\fP
does some reasonable printing).

.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_die_CU_offset_range()\fP
returns the offset of the beginning of the CU and the length of the CU.
The offset and length are of the entire CU that this DIE is
a part of.  It is used by dwarfdump (for example) to check

to
a pointer to a
null-terminated string of characters that represents the
name attribute
(\f(CWDW_AT_name\fP)
of
\f(CWdie\fP.
.P
The storage pointed to by a successful return of
\f(CWdwarf_diename()\fP
should not be freed
as the text is 
a string in static memory (for some error cases)
or a string residing in a DWARF data section.
.P
Up to March 2020 this document said that dwarf_dealloc
with DW_DLA_STRING 
should be applied to the string returned through the
pointer.
That was always incorrect.
However, doing the dwarf_dealloc(dbg,xxx,DW_DLA_STRING)
that was previously called for does not result
in any error (dwarf_dealloc avoids freeing strings
like this).
.P
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP if
\f(CWdie\fP does not have a name attribute.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP if
an error occurred.

.P
The storage pointed to by a successful return of
\f(CWdwarf_die_text()\fP must never be freed,
the string is in the DWARF data and is

.P
As of March 2020 the description here has been corrected.
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP
should never have been applied to
a string returned by 
\f(CWdwarf_die_text()\fP.
.P
It returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
if \f(CWdie\fP does not have the attribute
\f(CWattrnum\fP.
It returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP if
an error occurred.

.H 3 "dwarf_die_abbrev_code()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_die_abbrev_code( Dwarf_Die die)\fP
.DE
The function returns
the abbreviation code of the DIE.
That is, it returns the abbreviation "index"
into the abbreviation table for the compilation unit
of which the DIE is a part.
It cannot fail. No errors are possible.
The pointer \f(CWdie()\fP must not be NULL.

.H 3 "dwarf_die_abbrev_children_flag()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_die_abbrev_children_flag( Dwarf_Die die,
      Dwarf_Half *has_child)\fP
.DE
The function returns the has-children flag of the \f(CWdie\fP
passed in through the \f(CW*has_child\fP passed in and returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP on success.
A non-zero value of \f(CW*has_child\fP means the \f(CWdie\fP
has children.

On failure it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.

The function was developed to let
consumer code do better error reporting
in some circumstances, it is not generally needed.

.H 3 "dwarf_die_abbrev_global_offset()"

.DE
The function allows more detailed printing of abbreviation
data.
It is handy for analyzing abbreviations but is not
normally needed by applications.
The function first appears in March 2016.
.P
On success the function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
and sets
\f(CW*abbrev_offset\fP
to the global offset
in the
\f(CW.debug_abbrev\fP
section of the abbreviation.
It also sets
\f(CW*abbrev_count\fP
to the number of attribute/form
pairs in the abbreviation entry.
It is possible, though unusual, for the
count to be zero (meaning there is abbreviation
instance and a TAG instance which have no attributes).
.P
On failure it returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
and sets \f(CW*error\fP
.P
It should never return \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP,
but callers should allow for that possibility..

.H 3 "dwarf_get_version_of_die()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_get_version_of_die(Dwarf_Die die,
    Dwarf_Half *version,
    Dwarf_Half *offset_size)\fP
.DE
The function returns the CU context version through \f(CW*version\fP
and the CU context offset-size through \f(CW*offset_size\fP and
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP on success.

In case of error, the only errors possible involve
an inappropriate NULL \f(CWdie\fP pointer so no Dwarf_Debug
pointer is available.  Therefore setting a Dwarf_Error would not
be very meaningful (there is no Dwarf_Debug to
attach it to).  The function returns DW_DLV_ERROR on error.

The values returned through the pointers are the values
two arguments to  dwarf_get_form_class() requires.

.H 3 "dwarf_attrlist()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_attrlist(
    Dwarf_Die die,
    Dwarf_Attribute** attrbuf,
    Dwarf_Signed *attrcount,

.DE
When it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
the function \f(CWdwarf_attrlist()\fP sets \f(CWattrbuf\fP to point
to an array of \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptors corresponding to
each of the attributes in die, and returns the number of elements in
the array through \f(CWattrcount\fP.
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is returned if the count is zero (no
\f(CWattrbuf\fP is allocated in this case).
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned on error.
On a successful return from \f(CWdwarf_attrlist()\fP, each of the
\f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptors should be individually freed using
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP with the allocation type \f(CWDW_DLA_ATTR\fP,
followed by free-ing the list pointed to by \f(CW*attrbuf\fP using
\f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP with the allocation type \f(CWDW_DLA_LIST\fP,
when no longer of interest (see \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP).

It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP if
an error occurred.

.H 2 "Attribute Queries"
Based on the attributes form, these operations are concerned with
returning uninterpreted attribute data.  Since it is not always
obvious from the return value of these functions if an error occurred,
one should always supply an
\f(CWerror\fP
parameter or have arranged
to have an error handling function invoked (see
\f(CWdwarf_init()\fP
)
to determine the validity of the returned value and the nature of any
errors that may have occurred.

A \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor describes an attribute of a
specific die.  Thus, each \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor is
implicitly associated with a specific die.

.H 3 "dwarf_hasform()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_hasform(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Half form,
    Dwarf_Bool  *return_hasform,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_hasform()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and  and puts a
\fInon-zero\fP
 value in the
\f(CW*return_hasform\fP boolean if the
attribute represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor
\f(CWattr\fP has the attribute form \f(CWform\fP.
If the attribute does not have that form \fIzero\fP
is put into \f(CW*return_hasform\fP.
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned on error.

.H 3 "dwarf_whatform()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_whatform(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Half     *return_form,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_whatform()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_form\fP
to the attribute form code of
the attribute represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor
\f(CWattr\fP.
It returns  \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP  on error.

An attribute using DW_FORM_indirect effectively has two forms.
This function returns the 'final' form for \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP,
not the \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP itself. This function is
what most applications will want to call.

.H 3 "dwarf_whatform_direct()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_whatform_direct(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Half     *return_form,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_whatform_direct()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_form\fP
to the attribute form code of
the attribute represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor
\f(CWattr\fP.
It returns  \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP  on error.
An attribute using \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP effectively has two forms.
This returns the form 'directly' in the initial form field.
That is, it returns the 'initial' form of the attribute.
.P
So when the form field is \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP
this call returns the \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP form,
which is sometimes useful for dump utilities.
.P
It is confusing that the _direct() function returns
DW_FORM_indirect if an indirect form is involved.
Just think of this as returning the initial form the first
form value seen for the attribute, which is also the final
form unless the initial form is \f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP.

.H 3 "dwarf_whatattr()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_whatattr(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Half     *return_attr,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_whatattr()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_attr\fP
to the attribute code
represented by the \f(CWDwarf_Attribute\fP descriptor \f(CWattr\fP.
It returns  \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP  on error.

.H 3 "dwarf_formref()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formref(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Off     *return_offset,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_formref()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_offset\fP
to the CU-relative offset
represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the form of the attribute
belongs to the \f(CWREFERENCE\fP class.
\f(CWattr\fP must be a CU-local reference,
not form \f(CWDW_FORM_ref_addr\fP and not \f(CWDW_FORM_sec_offset\fP .
It is an error for the form to
not belong to the \f(CWREFERENCE\fP class.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

Beginning November 2010:
All \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP returns set \f(CW*return_offset\fP. Most
errors set \f(CW*return_offset\fP to zero, but
for error \f(CWDW_DLE_ATTR_FORM_OFFSET_BAD\fP
the function sets \f(CW*return_offset\fP to the invalid
offset (which allows the caller to print a more
detailed error message).

See also \f(CWdwarf_global_formref\fP below.


.H 3 "dwarf_global_formref()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_global_formref(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Off     *return_offset,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_global_formref()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_offset\fP
to the section-relative offset
represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the form of the attribute
belongs to the \f(CWREFERENCE\fP or other section-references classes.
.P
\f(CWattr\fP can be any legal
\f(CWREFERENCE\fP class form plus \f(CWDW_FORM_ref_addr\fP or
\f(CWDW_FORM_sec_offset\fP.
It is an error for the form to
not belong to one of the reference classes.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.
See also \f(CWdwarf_formref\fP above.
.P
The caller must determine which section the offset returned applies to.
The function \f(CWdwarf_get_form_class()\fP  is useful to determine
the applicable section.
.P
The function converts CU relative offsets from forms
such as DW_FORM_ref4 into
global section offsets.

.H 3 "dwarf_convert_to_global_offset()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_convert_to_global_offset(
        Dwarf_Attribute attr,
        Dwarf_Off     offset,
        Dwarf_Off     *return_offset,
        Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_convert_to_global_offset()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_offset\fP
to the section-relative offset
represented by the cu-relative offset \f(CWoffset\fP
if the form of the attribute
belongs to the \f(CWREFERENCE\fP class.
\f(CWattr\fP must be a CU-local reference (DWARF class REFERENCE)
or form \f(CWDW_FORM_ref_addr\fP and the \f(CWattr\fP
must be directly relevant for the calculated \f(CW*return_offset\fP
to mean anything.

The function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

The function is not strictly necessary but may be a
convenience for attribute printing  in case of error.


.H 3 "dwarf_formaddr()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formaddr(
        Dwarf_Attribute attr,
        Dwarf_Addr    * return_addr,
        Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_formaddr()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_addr\fP
to
the address
represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the form of the attribute
belongs to the \f(CWADDRESS\fP class.
It is an error for the form to
not belong to this class.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

One possible error that can arise (in a .dwo object file
or a .dwp package file) is
\f(CWDW_DLE_MISSING_NEEDED_DEBUG_ADDR_SECTION\fP.
Such an error means that the  .dwo or .dwp file
is missing the
\f(CW.debug_addr\fP
section.
When opening a .dwo object file or a .dwp package file
one should also open the corresponding executable
and use
\f(CWdwarf_set_tied_dbg()\fP
to associate the objects before calling dwarf_formaddr().



H 3 "dwarf_get_debug_addr_index()"

\f(CWint dwarf_get_debug_addr_index(
        Dwarf_Attribute attr,
        Dwarf_Unsigned  * return_index,
        Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
\f(CWdwarf_get_debug_addr_index()\fP
is only valid on attributes with form
\f(CWDW_FORM_GNU_addr_index\fP
or
\f(CWDW_FORM_addrx\fP.

The function makes it possible
to print the
index from a dwarf dumper program.

When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_get_debug_addr_index()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_index\fP
to
the attribute's index (into the
\f(CW.debug_addr\fP section).

It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.



.H 3 "dwarf_get_debug_str_index()"

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_get_debug_str_index(
        Dwarf_Attribute  attr,
        Dwarf_Unsigned * return_index,
        Dwarf_Error *    error);\fP
.DE
.P
For an attribute with  form
\f(CWDW_FORM_strx\fP
or
\f(CWDW_FORM_GNU_str_index\fP
this function retrieves the index (which refers
to a .debug_str_offsets section in this .dwo).
.P
If successful, the function
\f(CWdwarf_get_debug_str_index()\fP
returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
and
returns the index through the
\f(CWreturn_index()\fP pointer.
.P
If the passed in attribute does not have
this form or there is no valid compilation
unit context for the attribute the
function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
.P
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is not returned.

.H 3 "dwarf_formflag()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formflag(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Bool * return_bool,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
When it succeeds,
\f(CWdwarf_formflag()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_bool\fP
to the (one unsigned byte) flag value.
Any non-zero value means true.
A zero value means false.

Before 29 November 2012 this would only return 1 or zero
through the pointer, but that was always a strange thing to do.
The DWARF specification has always been clear that any non-zero
value means true.  The function should report the value
found truthfully, and now it does.

It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error or if the \f(CWattr\fP
does not have form flag.

.H 3 "dwarf_formudata()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formudata(
    Dwarf_Attribute   attr,
    Dwarf_Unsigned  * return_uvalue,
    Dwarf_Error     * error)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWdwarf_formudata()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_uvalue\fP
to
the \f(CWDwarf_Unsigned\fP
value of the attribute represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the
form of the attribute belongs to the \f(CWCONSTANT\fP class.
It is an
error for the form to not belong to this class.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

Never returns \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.

For DWARF2 and DWARF3, \f(CWDW_FORM_data4\fP and \f(CWDW_FORM_data8\fP
are possibly class \f(CWCONSTANT\fP,
and for DWARF4 and later they
are definitely class \f(CWCONSTANT\fP.

.H 3 "dwarf_formsdata()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formsdata(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Signed  * return_svalue,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_formsdata()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_svalue\fP
to
the \f(CWDwarf_Signed\fP
value of the attribute represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the
form of the attribute belongs to the \f(CWCONSTANT\fP class.
It is an
error for the form to not belong to this class.
If the size of the data
attribute referenced is smaller than the size of the \f(CWDwarf_Signed\fP
type, its value is sign extended.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

Never returns \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.

For DWARF2 and DWARF3, \f(CWDW_FORM_data4\fP and \f(CWDW_FORM_data8\fP
are possibly class \f(CWCONSTANT\fP,
and for DWARF4 and later they
are definitely class \f(CWCONSTANT\fP.

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formblock(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    Dwarf_Block  ** return_block,
    Dwarf_Error *   error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_formblock()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_block\fP
to
a pointer to a
\f(CWDwarf_Block\fP structure containing the value of the attribute
represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the form of the
attribute belongs to the \f(CWBLOCK\fP class.
It is an error
for the form to not belong to this class.
The storage pointed
to by a successful return of \f(CWdwarf_formblock()\fP should
be freed using the allocation type \f(CWDW_DLA_BLOCK\fP,  when
no longer of interest (see \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP).
It returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.


.H 3 "dwarf_formstring()"

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_formstring(
    Dwarf_Attribute attr,
    char        **  return_string,
    Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_formstring()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets \f(CW*return_string\fP
to
a pointer to a
null-terminated string containing  the value of the attribute
represented by the descriptor \f(CWattr\fP if the form of the
attribute belongs to the \f(CWSTRING\fP class.
It is an error
for the form to not belong to this class.
.P
The storage pointed
to by a successful return of \f(CWdwarf_formstring()\fP
should not be freed.  The pointer points into
existing DWARF memory and the pointer becomes stale/invalid
after a call to \f(CWdwarf_finish\fP.
\f(CWdwarf_formstring()\fP returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.

.H 3 "dwarf_formsig8()"

\f(CWint dwarf_formsig8(
        Dwarf_Attribute attr,
        Dwarf_Sig8  * return_sig8,
        Dwarf_Error *   error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_formsig8()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and copies the 8 byte signature
to a \f(CWDwarf_Sig8\fP structure provided by the caller
if the form of the
attribute is of form \f(CWDW_FORM_ref_sig8\fP
( a member of the \f(CWREFERENCE\fP class).
It is an error
for the form to be anything but \f(CWDW_FORM_ref_sig8\fP.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.
.P
This form is used to refer to a type unit.

.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_formexprloc()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets the two values thru the pointers
to the length and bytes of the DW_FORM_exprloc entry
if the form of the
attribute is of form \f(CWDW_FORM_experloc\fP.
It is an error
for the form to be anything but \f(CWDW_FORM_exprloc\fP.
It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP on error.
.P
On success the value set through the
\f(CWreturn_exprlen\fP pointer is the length
of the location expression.
On success the value set through the
\f(CWblock_ptr\fP pointer is a pointer to
the bytes of the location expression itself.

.DE
.P
The function is just for the convenience
of libdwarf clients that might wish to categorize
the FORM of a particular attribute.
The DWARF specification divides FORMs into classes
in Chapter 7 and this function figures out the correct
class for a form.
.P
The \f(CWdwversion\fP passed in shall be the dwarf version
of the compilation unit involved (2 for DWARF2, 3 for
DWARF3, 4 for DWARF 4).
The \f(CWattrnum\fP passed in shall be the attribute
number of the attribute involved (for example, \f(CWDW_AT_name\fP ).
The \f(CWoffset_size\fP passed in shall be the
length of an offset in the current compilation unit
(4 for 32bit dwarf or 8 for 64bit dwarf).
The \f(CWform\fP passed in shall be the attribute form number.
If \f(CWform\fP
\f(CWDW_FORM_indirect\fP
is passed in \f(CWDW_FORM_CLASS_UNKNOWN\fP will be returned
as this form has no defined 'class'.
.P
When it returns \f(CWDW_FORM_CLASS_UNKNOWN\fP the
function is simply saying it could not determine the
correct class given the arguments
presented.  Some user-defined
attributes might have this problem.

The function \f(CWdwarf_get_version_of_die()\fP may be helpful
in filling out arguments for a call to \f(CWdwarf_get_form_class()\fP.

When it succeeds,

the high end of the discriminant range.
.P
Due to the nature of the LEB numbers in
the discriminant representation in DWARF
one must call the correct one of
\f(CWdwarf_discr_entry_u()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_discr_entry_s()\fP
based on whether the discriminant is
signed or unsigned.
Casting an unsigned to signed is
not always going to get the right value.
.P
If
\f(CWdsc_array_index\fP
is outside the range of valid indexes
the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.
On error it returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

In addition, if 
\f(CW*debug_addr_unavailable\fP

the .debug_addr section is missing.
Very likely the .debug_addr section

The function

returns
the information for the single operator

It sets the following values.
.P
\f(CWatom_out\fP

\f(CWDW_OP_reg5\fP.
.P
\f(CWoperand1\fP,
\f(CWoperand2\fP, and

operator operands as applicable (see
DWARF documents on the operands
for each operator).
All additions of base fields, if any,
have been done already.
\f(CWoperand3\fP is new as of DWARF5.
.P
In some cases 
\f(CWoperand3\fP
is actually a pointer into section data in memory
and operand2 has the length of the data at
operand3. Callers must extract the bytes and
deal with endianness issues of the extracted value.
.P
\f(CWrawop1\fP,
\f(CWrawop2\fP, and
\f(CWrawop3\fP are set to the
operator operands as applicable (see
DWARF documents on the operands
for each operator) before any
base values were added in..
As for the previous, sometimes dealing
with
\f(CWrawop3\fP means interpreting it as a pointer
and doing a dereference.

.P
More on the pointer values in Dwarf_Unsigned: 
When a DWARF operand is not of a size
fixed by dwarf or whose type
is unknown, or is possibly too large for
a dwarf stack entry, libdwarf will
insert a pointer (to memory
in the dwarf data somewhere) as the operand value.
\f(CWDW_OP_implicit_value operand 2\fP,
\f(CWDW_OP_[GNU_]entry_value operand 2\fP,
and
\f(CWDW_OP_[GNU_]const_type operand 3\fP
are instances of this.
The problem with the values is that libdwarf
is unclear what the type of the value is
so we pass the problem to you, the callers!
.P
\f(CWoffset_for_branch\fP is set to the
offset (in bytes) in this expression of this
operator.
The value makes it possible for callers
to implement the operator branch
operators.
.P
In case of an error, the
function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
and sets
\f(CW*error\fP to an error
value.
.P
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
is probably not a possible return value, but
please test for it anyway.

This interface is not sufficient

The earlier versions
\f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr()\fP,
\f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()\fP,
and
\f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr_b\fP
are all similarly deficient.
These suffice for early DWARF locations
but cannot work for every kind of
DWARF5 location list or location.
.P
Frame operators such as
DW_CFA_def_cfa_expression have a location expression
and the location_expression is accessed with
this function.
.P
On success it returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets the two return arguments
(explained a few lines later here).
.P
The
\f(CWexpression_in\fP
argument must contain a valid pointer
to location expression bytes.
The
\f(CWexpression_length\fP
argument must contain the length of
that location expression in bytes.
.P
The
\f(CWaddress_size\fP
argument must contain the size of an address
on the target machine for this expression
(normally 4 or 8).
The
\f(CWoffset_size\fP
argument must contain the size of an offset
in the expression
(normally 4, sometimes 8).
The
\f(CWversion\fP
argument must contain the dwarf_version
of the expression
(2,3,4, or 5).
.P
The returned value
\f(CW*loc_head\fP
is  used to actually access the location expression
details (see the example following).
.P
The returned value
\f(CW*listlen\fP
is  the number of location expressions
(ie 1) in the location list
(for uniformity of access we make it look like
a single-entry location list).
.P
On error the function returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
and sets
\f(CW*error\fP to reflect
the error.
.P
A return of
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
is probably impossible, but
callers should assume it is possible.
No return arguments are set in this case.

.DE
This function is obsolete.
Use \f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr_b()\fP instead.
This function is obsolete.
.P
The function \f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()\fP
is identical to  \f(CWdwarf_loclist_from_expr()\fP
in every way except that the caller passes the additional argument
\f(CWaddr_size\fP containing the address size (normally 4 or 8)
applying this location expression.
.P
The \f(CWaddr_size\fP argument (added 27April2009) is needed
to correctly interpret frame information as different compilation
units can have different address sizes.
DWARF4 adds address_size to the CIE header.

.P
.H 2 "Line Number Operations"
These functions are concerned with accessing line number entries,
mapping debugging information entry objects to their corresponding
source lines, and providing a mechanism for obtaining information
about line number entries.  Although, the interface talks of "lines"
what is really meant is "statements".  In case there is more than
one statement on the same line, there will be at least one descriptor
per statement, all with the same line number.  If column number is
also being represented they will have the column numbers of the start
of the statements also represented.
.P
There can also be more than one Dwarf_Line per statement.
For example, if a file is preprocessed by a language translator,
this could result in translator output showing 2 or more sets of line
numbers per translated line of output.
.P
\f(CW
\fP
As of October 2015 there are two sets of overall access
and release functions.
The older set of functions is
\f(CWdwarf_srclines()\fP
with
\f(CWdwarf_srclines_dealloc()\fP.
This set does not handle line table
headers with no lines.
.P
A newer set is
\f(CWdwarf_srclines_b()\fP
with
\f(CWdwarf_srclines_from_linecontext()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_srclines_dealloc_b()\fP.
These functions provide for handling
both DWARF2 through DWARF5 details
and give access to line header
information even if there are no lines
in a particular compilation unit's line
table.
.P



.H 3 "Get A Set of Lines (including skeleton line tables)"
This set of functions works on any DWARF version.
DWARF2,3,4,5 and the DWARF4 based experimental
two-level line tables are all supported.
What was once done by dwarf_srclines() alone
is now done with two calls as described here.
.P
The interfaces support reading GNU two-level line tables.
The format of such tables is a topic beyond
the scope of this document.

a pointer to a compilation-unit (CU)  DIE.
The other arguments are used to return values

On success
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
is returned and values
are returned through the pointers.
If there is no line table
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP
is returned
and no values are returned though the pointers.
If
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

.DE
\f(CW*dwarf_get_line_section_name_from_die()\fP
retrieves the object file section name of
the applicable line section.
This is useful for applications wanting to print
the name, but of course the object section name is not
really a part of the DWARF information.
Most applications will
probably not call this function.
It can be called at any time
after the Dwarf_Debug initialization is done.
.P
If the function succeeds, \f(CW*sec_name\fP is set to
a pointer to a string with the object section name and
the function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP.
Do not free the string whose pointer is returned.
For non-Elf objects it is possible the string pointer
returned will be NULL or will point to an empty string.
It is up to the calling application to recognize this
possibility and deal with it appropriately.
.P
If the section does not exist the function returns
DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY.
.P
If there is an internal error detected the
function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP and sets the
\f(CW*error\fP pointer.

as well as all the other sections with this
specific format and purpose:
 .debug_pubtypes,
 .debug_typenames,
 .debug_varnames,
 .debug_funcnames,
 and .debug_weaknames.
The first in the list is generic DWARF 2,3,4.
The second in the list is generic DWARF 3,4.
The rest are SGI specific and rarely used.
.P
The interface types are Dwarf_Global
Dwarf_Type,Dwarf_Weak,Dwarf_Func, and Dwarf_Var.
Only Dwarf_Global is a real type. The others
are opaque pointers with no actual
definition or instantiation and can be converted
to Dwarf_Global with a simple cast.
.P
In hindsight it would have been simpler to
write a single set of interfaces for Accelerated
Access By Name.

.H 3 "Fine Tuning Accelerated Access"
By default the various dwarf_get*() functions
here return an array of pointers to opaque records
with a .debug_info DIE offset and a string
(the fields are accessible by function calls).
While the actual .debug_pubnames (etc) section
contains CU-local DIE offsets for the named
things the accelerated access functions below
return a .debug_info (or .debug_types)
global section offset.
.P

.H 4 "dwarf_return_empty_pubnames"
New March 2019. Mostly special for dwarfdump.
If called with a flag value of one (1)
it tells libdwarf, for any pubnames(etc)
section list returned to add to the list
an entry with a global-DIE-offset of zero (0)
for any section Compilation Unit entry with no pubnames(etc)
name( ie, an empty list for the Compilation Unit).
.P
If called with a value of zero(0) (zero is the default
set by any 
\f(CWdwarf_init*()\fP
call) it causes such empty lists to be omitted from
the array of pointers returned, which
is the standard behavior of libdwarf since libdwarf
was first written.
.P
Since zero is never a valid DIE offset in .debug_info
(or .debug_types) consumers requesting such
can detect the special Dwarf_Global entries.
.P
For example, calling
\f(CW dwarf_global_name_offsets()\fP
on one of the special global records
sets
\f(CW*die_offset\fP
to 0,
\f(CW*return_name\fP 
to a pointer to an empty string,
and
\f(CW*cu_offset\fP
to the offset of the compilation
unit die in the .debug_info 
(or .debug_types if applicable) section.

If \f(CWis_info\fP is non-zero the \f(CWin_cu_header_offset\fP must refer

.P
If a portion of .debug_pubnames ( or .debug_types etc)
represents a compilation unit with no names there
is a .debug_pubnames header there with no content.
In that case a single Dwarf_Global record is
created with the value of *die_offset zero
and the name-pointer returned points to the empty string. 
A zero is never a valid DIE offset, so zero always
means this is an uninteresting (Dwarf_Global).

.H 2 "Names Fast Access .debug_gnu_pubnames"
The sections
\f(CW.debug_gnu_pubnames\fP
and
\f(CW.debug_gnu_pubtypes\fP
are non-standard sections emitted by
gcc and clang with DWARF5.
Typically they will be in the skeleton
executable and the split dwarf section
\f(CW.debug_info.dwo\fP
will have the actual
DWARF the offsets refer to,
These sections would normally be read
once by a program wanting them and
filed in an internal format and
then the program would do the cleanup
\f(CWdwarf_gnu_index_dealloc()\fP.
.P
Each section is divided into what
we term blocks here and within
each block there is an array of entries.
The functions below enable access.

has the byte length of the block (with its entries).
.P
The field
\f(CWversion\fP
has the version number.
Currently it must be 2.

.P
The field
\f(CWoffsetinto_debug_info\fP
is the offset (in some .debug_info

a Compilation Unit Header.

.P
The field
\f(CWsize_of_debug_info_area\fP
is the size of the referenced 
compilation unit.

.P
The field
\f(CWcount_of_index_entries\fP

Any pointers pased in as NULL are ignored.

.P
The field
\f(CWoffset_in_debug_info\fP
has the offset of DIE in
a .debug_info section.

The field
\f(CWstaticorglobal\fP
has an integer 0
if the DIE involved describes 
a global (externally-visible)
name.
It has an integer 1
if the name refers to a static (file-local)
DIE.
.P
The field
\f(CWtypeofentry\fP
has a small integer describing the type.
Zero means the type is "none".
One means the type is "type".
Two means the type is "variable".
Three means the type is "function".
Four means the type is "other".
Any other value has, apparently,
no assigned meaning.

.P
If there is data corruption
or some serious error it returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
and sets the error pointer with
information about the error.

.H 2 "Macro Information Operations (DWARF4, DWARF5)"
This section refers to DWARF4 and later
macro information from the .debug_macro
section (for DWARF 4 some producers
generated .debug_macro before its formal
standardization in DWARF 5).
While standard operations are supported there
is as yet no support for implementation-defined
extensions.
Once someone has defined such things it will
make sense to design an interface for extensions.

.P
The value
\f(CWversion_out\fP
is set to the DWARF version number of the macro data.
Version 5 means DWARF5 version information. Version 4
means the DWARF5 format macro data is present as an
extension of DWARF4.
.P
The value
\f(CWmacro_unit_offset_out\fP
is set to the offset in the .debug_macro section
of the first byte of macro data for this CU.

Macro unit is defined in the DWARF5 standard, 
Section 6.3 Macro Information on page 165.
.P
The value
\f(CWmacro_ops_count_out\fP

data for this CU.
The count includes the final zero entry (which is not
really a macro, it is a terminator, a zero byte ending
the macro unit).
.P
The value
\f(CWmacro_ops_data_length_out\fP

.H 2 "Low Level Frame Operations"
These functions provide information about stack frames to be
used to perform stack traces.  The information is an abstraction
of a table with a row per instruction and a column per register
and a column for the canonical frame address (CFA, which corresponds
to the notion of a frame pointer),
as well as a column for the return address.
.P
From 1993-2006 the interface we'll here refer to as DWARF2
made the CFA be a column in the matrix, but left
DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL, and DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL out of the matrix
(giving them high numbers). As of the DWARF3 interfaces
introduced in this document in April 2006, there are *two*
interfaces (the original set and a new set).
Several frame functions work transparently for either set, we
will focus on the ones that are not equally suitable
now.
.P
The original DWARF2 interface set still exists
(dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg(),
dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg(), and dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs())
and works adequately for MIPS/IRIX DWARF2 and ABI/ISA sets
that are sufficiently similar to MIPS.
These functions not a good choice for non-MIPS architectures nor
were they a good design for MIPS either.
It's better to switch entirely to the new functions mentioned
in the next paragraph.
This DWARF2 interface set assumes and uses DW_FRAME_CFA_COL
and that is assumed when libdwarf is configured with --enable-oldframecol .
.P
A new DWARF3 interface set of dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3(),
dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3(), dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3(),
dwarf_set_frame_rule_table_size()
dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value(),
dwarf_set_frame_same_value(),
dwarf_set_frame_undefined_value(), and
dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value()
is more flexible
and will work for many more architectures.
It is also entirely suitable for use with DWARF2 and DWARF4.
The setting of  the 'frame cfa column number'
defaults to DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3
and it can be set at runtime with dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value().
.P
Mixing use of the DWARF2 interface set with use
of the new DWARF3 interface set
on a single open Dwarf_Debug instance is a mistake.
Do not do it.
.P
We will pretend, from here on unless otherwise
specified, that
DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3, DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL,
and DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL are the synthetic column numbers.
These columns may be user-chosen by calls of
dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value()
dwarf_set_frame_undefined_value(), and
dwarf_set_frame_same_value() respectively.

.P
Each cell in the table contains one of the following:

.AL
.LI
A register + offset(a)(b)

.LI
A register(c)(d)


.LI
A marker (DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL) meaning \fIregister value undefined\fP

.LI
A marker (DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL) meaning
\fIregister value same as in caller\fP
.LE
.P
(a old DWARF2 interface) When  the column is DW_FRAME_CFA_COL:
the register
number is a real hardware register, not a reference
to DW_FRAME_CFA_COL, not  DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL,
and not DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL.
The CFA rule value should be the stack pointer
plus offset 0 when no other value makes sense.
A value of DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL would
be semi-logical, but since the CFA is not a real register,
not really correct.
A value of DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL would imply
the CFA is undefined  --
this seems to be a useless notion, as
the CFA is a means to finding real registers,
so those real registers should be marked DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL,
and the CFA column content (whatever register it
specifies) becomes unreferenced by anything.
.P
(a new April 2006 DWARF2/3 interface): The CFA is
separately accessible and not part of the table.
The 'rule number' for the CFA is a number outside the table.
So the CFA is a marker, not a register number.
See  DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 in libdwarf.h and
dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3() and
dwarf_set_frame_rule_cfa_value().
.P
(b) When the column is not DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3, the 'register'
will and must be DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3(COL), implying that
to get the final location for the column one must add
the offset here plus the DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 rule value.
.P
(c) When the column is DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3, then the 'register'
number is (must be) a real hardware register .
(This paragraph does not apply to the April 2006 new interface).
If it were DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL or DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL
it would be a marker, not a register number.
.P
(d) When the column is not DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3, the register
may be a hardware register.
It will not be DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.
.P
There is no 'column' for DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL or DW_FRAME_SAME_VAL.
Nor for DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3.

If one has called
\f(CWdwarf_get_fde_list()\fP
must avoid dwarf_dealloc-ing the FDEs and  the CIEs for those FDEs
individually (see its documentation here).
Failing to observe this restriction will cause the  FDE(s) not
dealloc'd to become invalid: an FDE contains (hidden in it)
a CIE pointer which will be be invalid (stale, pointing to freed memory)
if the CIE is dealloc'd.
The invalid CIE pointer internal to the FDE cannot be detected
as invalid by libdwarf.
If one later passes an FDE with a stale internal CIE pointer
to one of the routines taking an FDE as input the result will
be failure of the call (returning DW_DLV_ERROR) at best and
it is possible a coredump or worse will happen (eventually).

\f(CWdwarf_get_cie_of_fde()\fP returns

It sets \f(CW*value_type\fP
to one of  DW_EXPR_OFFSET (0),

On call, \f(CWtable_column\fP must be set to the

It sets \f(CW*offset_relevant\fP to
non-zero if the offset is relevant for the
row specified by \f(CWpc_requested\fP and column specified by
\f(CWtable_column\fP or, for the FDE specified by \f(CWfde\fP.
In this case  the  \f(CW*register_num\fP will be set
to DW_FRAME_CFA_COL3 (.  This is an offset(N) rule
as specified in the DWARF3/2 documents.
.P
Adding the value of \f(CW*offset_or_block_len\fP

of a location holding the previous value of
register \f(CWtable_column\fP.

.P
If offset is not relevant for this rule, \f(CW*offset_relevant\fP is
set to zero.  \f(CW*register_num\fP will be set
to the number of the real register holding the value of
the \f(CWtable_column\fP register.
This is the register(R) rule as specified in DWARF3/2 documents.
.P
The
intent is to return the rule for the given pc value and register.
The location pointed to by \f(CWregister_num\fP is set to the register
value for the rule.
The location pointed to by \f(CWoffset\fP
is set to the offset value for the rule.
Since more than one pc
value will have rows with identical entries, the user may want to
know the earliest pc value after which the rules for all the columns
remained unchanged.
Recall that in the virtual table that the frame information
represents there may be one or more table rows with identical data
(each such table row at a different pc value).
Given a \f(CWpc_requested\fP which refers to a pc in such a group
of identical rows,
the location pointed to by \f(CWrow_pc\fP is set
to the lowest pc value
within the group of  identical rows.

If \f(CW*value_type\fP has the value DW_EXPR_VAL_OFFSET (1) then:
.in +4
This will be a val_offset(N) rule as specified in the
DWARF3/2 documents so  \f(CW*offset_relevant\fP will
be non zero.
The calculation is identical to the  DW_EXPR_OFFSET (0)

\f(CW*block_ptr\fP is set to point at the block of memory.
The consumer code should  evaluate the block as
a DWARF-expression. The result is the address where
the previous value of the register may be found.
This is a DWARF3/2 expression(E) rule.

If \f(CW*value_type\fP has the value DW_EXPR_VAL_EXPRESSION (1) then:

Most applications will
probably not call this function.
It can be called at any time
after the Dwarf_Debug initialization is done.
See  also \f(CWdwarf_get_die_section_name_b()\fP.

The function
\f(CWdwarf_get_string_section_name()\fP operates on

If the function succeeds, \f(CW*sec_name\fP is set to

Do not free the string whose pointer is returned.
For non-Elf objects it is possible the string pointer
returned will be NULL or will point to an empty string.
It is up to the calling application to recognize this
possibility and deal with it appropriately.
.P
If the section does not exist the function returns
DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY.

If there is no .debug_str section, \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is returned.
If there is an error, \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned.
If we are at the end of the section (that is, \f(CWoffset\fP

If the \f(CWoffset\fP is some other too-large value then
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is returned.

.H 2 "String Offsets Section Operations"
The .debug_str_offsets section contains only
table arrays (with headers) and Debuggers should never

The function \f(CWdwarf_get_die_address_size()\fP
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP on success and sets
the \f(CW*addr_size\fP
to the size in bytes of an address.
In case of error, it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

.H 2 "Ranges Operations DWARF5 (.debug_rnglists)"
These functions provide information about the address ranges
indicated by a  \f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP attribute 
of a DIE. The ranges are recorded
in the  \f(CW.debug_rnglists\fP section.
.P
The section
requires that each group of ranges
has a header and the compilation unit
may have a
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges_base\fP
attribute that must be added to
the \f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP attribute value
to get the true ranges offset.
.P
(A compiler generating
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges_base\fP
will add a relocation for that attribute value
but will not have to make the
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP
attributes relocatable and will thus save space
in the object (ie, .o) file
and save link time.)
.P
See DWARF5 Section 2.17.3 Non-Contiguous Address Ranges
and Section 7.28 Range List Table.
.P
Section 7.28 describes the header fields for a Range List
Table.  There will usually be many such tables, in some
sequence, in the .debug_rnglists section.
Here we call each header 
\f(CWDwarf_Rnglists_Head\fP

.H 2 "Ranges Operations DWARF3,4 (.debug_ranges)"
These functions provide information about the address ranges
indicated by a  \f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP attribute (the ranges are recorded
in the  \f(CW.debug_ranges\fP section) of a DIE.
These functions apply to 
DWARF3 and
DWARF4.
Each call of \f(CWdwarf_get_ranges_a()\fP
or \f(CWdwarf_get_ranges()\fP
returns a an array
of Dwarf_Ranges structs, each of which represents a single ranges
entry.   The struct is defined in  \f(CWlibdwarf.h\fP.
.P
New in DWARF3,
for DWARF3, and DWARF4 the section contains
just ranges.
The ranges are referenced by
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP
attributes in various DIEs.
.P
For DWARF5 the section 
requires that each group of ranges
has a header and the compilation unit
may have a
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges_base\fP
attribute that must be added to
the \f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP attribute value
to get the true ranges offset.
.P
(A compiler generating
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges_base\fP
will add a relocation for that attribute value
but will not have to make the 
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP
attributes relocatable and will thus save space
in the object (ie, .o) file
and link time.)

\f(CW*dwarf_get_ranges_section_name()\fP
retrieves the object file section name of
the applicable ranges section.
This is useful for applications wanting to print
the name, but of course the object section name is not
really a part of the DWARF information.
Most applications will
probably not call this function.
It can be called at any time
after the Dwarf_Debug initialization is done.
.P
If the function succeeds, \f(CW*sec_name\fP is set to
a pointer to a string with the object section name and
the function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP.
Do not free the string whose pointer is returned.
For non-Elf objects it is possible the string pointer
returned will be NULL or will point to an empty string.
It is up to the calling application to recognize this
possibility and deal with it appropriately.
.P
If the section does not exist the function returns
DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY.
.P
If there is an internal error detected the
function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP and sets the
\f(CW*error\fP pointer.


.H 3 "dwarf_get_ranges()"
This is the original call and it will work fine when
all compilation units have the same address_size.

.H 3 "dwarf_get_ranges_a()"
This is the same as 
\f(CWdwarf_get_ranges_b()\fP
except it is missing the
\f(CWfinaloffset\fP
pointer argument, so when
reading DWARF4 split-dwarf
GNU extension DIEs 
it's not possible to know the final
offset of the ranges, but few
applications will care..

.DE
The function 
\f(CWdwarf_get_ranges_b()\fP returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and sets 
\f(CW*returned_ranges_count\fP to
the count of the
number of address ranges in the group of ranges
in the .debug_ranges section where the
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP attribute gives offset
\f(CWoffset\fP.
This function is new as of 10 September 2020.
.P
DWARF4 GNU split-dwarf extension ONLY:
With a .dwp object and the tied (executable,a.out)
involved the actual .debug_ranges
offset is determined from the 
DW_AT_GNU_ranges_base from the tied file and
the offset from  
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP in the .dwp object and
returned through the
\f(CWfinaloffset\fP pointer.
If \f(CWfinaloffset\fP pointer is null the
function ignores it.
.P
If there is no use of the GNU split-dwarf
extension to DWARF4 the
\f(CWfinaloffset\fP value returned is identical to
the \f(CWoffset\fP passed in.
If the pointer is null it is ignored by the function.
.P
This function is normally used when one has
a DIE
with the 
\f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP
attribute (whose value is the offset needed).
The ranges thus apply to the DIE involved.
.P
See also 
\f(CWdwarf_get_aranges()\fP,
.P
The
\f(CWoffset\fP argument should be the value of
a \f(CWDW_AT_ranges\fP
attribute of a Debugging Information Entry.

The
\f(CWdie\fP
argument should be the value of
a 
\f(CWDwarf_Die\fP pointer of a
\f(CWDwarf_Die\fP with
the attribute containing
this range set offset.  
Because each compilation unit
has its own address_size field this argument is necessary to
to correctly read ranges.
(Most executables have the
same address_size in every compilation unit, but
some ABIs allow multiple address sized in an executable).
If a NULL pointer is passed in libdwarf assumes
a single address_size is appropriate for all ranges records.

On success,
The call sets
\f(CW*ranges\fP to point to a block of 
\f(CWDwarf_Ranges\fP
structs, one for each address range.
If the
\f(CW*returned_byte_count\fP pointer is passed as non-NULL
the number of bytes that the returned ranges
were taken from is returned through the pointer
(for example if the returned_ranges_count is 2
and the pointer-size
is 4, then returned_byte_count will be 8).
If the
\f(CW*returned_byte_count\fP pointer is passed as NULL
the parameter is ignored.
The
\f(CW*returned_byte_count\fP is only of use to certain
dumper applications, most applications will not use it.
The
\f(CWfinaloffset\fP pointer is only of use to certain
dumper applications, and if null is passed the function
ignores the argument.

.P
On error the function returns 
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
.P
It returns 
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP if there is no
\f(CW.debug_ranges\fP
section or if 
\f(CWoffset\fP is past the end of the
\f(CW.debug_ranges\fP section.

.P
On success it returns

Two fields must be free()d to avoid a memory leak.
None of the other fields should be freed.

\f(CW*buildid_returned\fP will be set to 
point to the group of bytes
of length
\f(CW*buildid_length_returned\fP.
This is not a string and is not null-terminated.
It is normally a 20-byte field to be used
in its ascii-hex form.
Do not free() this.
The bytes are in the object itself

dwarf_finish() is run on the dbg.
.P
If \f(CW*paths_returned\fP
is passed as NULL then no paths
calculation will be made and
\f(CW*paths_count_returned\fP
is not referenced by libdwarf.
.P
If \f(CW*paths_returned\fP
is
passed in non-NULL then
\f(CW*paths_returned\fP
and
\f(CW*paths_count_returned\fP
provide an array of pointers-to-strings
(with the actual strings following
the array) and the count of the
pointers in the array.
When the strings are no longer needed
free()
\f(CW*paths_returned\fP.
The number of paths returned will depend
on which (of the two) sections exist and on
how many global paths have been set
by 
\f(CWdwarf_add_debuglink_global_path()\fP.
and defined by the rules described in the

.H 2 "Debug Fission (.debug_tu_index, .debug_cu_index) operations"
We name things "xu" as these sections have the same format
so we let "x" stand for either section.
The DWARF5 standard refers to Split Dwarf while
libdwarf tends to refer to this as "Fission".
.P
These functions get access to the  index functions needed
to access and print the contents of an object file
which is an aggregate of .dwo objects.
These sections are implemented in gcc/gdb and are
DWARF5.
The idea is that much debug information can be separated
off into individual .dwo Elf objects and then aggregated
simply into a single .dwp object so the executable need not
have the complete debug information in it at runtime
yet allow good debugging.
.P
For additional information, see
"https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFissionDWP",
"https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission",
and
"http://www.bayarea.net/~cary/dwarf/Accelerated%20Access%20Diagram.png"

.P
There are FORM access functions related
to Debug Fission (Split Dwarf).
See
\f(CWdwarf_formaddr()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_get_debug_addr_index()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_get_debug_str_index()\fP.
.P
The FORM with the hash value (for a reference
to  a type unit ) is
\f(CWDW_FORM_ref_sig8\fP.
.P
In a compilation unit of  Debug Fission object
(or a .dwp Package FIle)
\f(CWDW_AT_dwo_id\fP
the hash is expected to be
\f(CWDW_FORM_data8\fP.
.P
The \f(CWDWARF5\fP standard defines the hash as an 8 byte value
which we could use \f(CWDwarf_Unsigned\fP.
Instead (and mostly for type safety) we define
the value as  a structure whose type name is
\f(CWDwarf_Sig8\fP.

.P
To look up a name in the hash (to find
which CU(s) it exists in).
use
\f(CWdwarf_get_debugfission_for_key()\fP,
defined below.
.P
The second group of interfaces here
beginning with
\f(CWdwarf_get_xu_index_header()\fP
are useful if one wants to print
a .debug_tu_index or .debug_cu_index section.
.P
To access DIE, macro, etc information
the support is built into DIE, Macro, etc operations
so applications usually won't need to use these
operations at all.

.H 2 "TAG ATTR etc names as strings"
These functions turn a value into a string.
So applications wanting the string "DW_TAG_compile_unit"
given the value 0x11 (the value defined for this TAG) can do so easily.

The general form is
.in +2
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_get_<something>_name(
    unsigned value,
    char **s_out,
    );\fP
.DE
.in -2

If the \f(CWvalue\fP passed in is known, the function
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP and places a pointer to the appropriate string
into  \f(CW*s_out\fP.   The string is in static storage
and applications must never free the string.
If the \f(CWvalue\fP is not known, \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP is returned
and \f(CW*s_out\fP is not set.  \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP is never returned.

\f(CWLibdwarf\fP generates these functions at libdwarf build time
by reading dwarf.h.

All these follow this pattern rigidly, so the details of each
are not repeated for each function.

The choice of 'unsigned' for the value type argument (the code value)
argument is somewhat arbitrary, 'int' could have been used.

The library simply assumes the value passed in is applicable.
So, for example,
passing a TAG value code to  \f(CWdwarf_get_ACCESS_name()\fP
is a coding error which libdwarf will process as if it was
an accessibility code value.
Examples of bad and good usage are:

.H 3 "dwarf_get_ADDR_name()"
Returns an address type encoding name  through the \f(CWs_out\fP pointer.
As of this writing only  \f(CWDW_ADDR_none\fP is defined in  \f(CWdwarf.h\fP.
.H 3 "dwarf_get_ATCF_name()"
Returns a SUN code flag encoding name  through the \f(CWs_out\fP pointer.
This code flag is entirely a DWARF extension.
.H 3 "dwarf_get_CHILDREN_name()"
Returns a child determination name (which
is seen in the abbreviations section data) through the \f(CWs_out\fP pointer.
The only value this recognizes for a 'yes' value is 1.
As a flag value this is not quite correct (any non-zero value means
yes) but dealing with this is left up to client code (normally
compilers really do emit a value of 1 for a flag).
.H 3 "dwarf_get_children_name()"
Returns a child determination name through the \f(CWs_out\fP pointer,
though this version is really a libdwarf artifact.
The standard function is  \f(CWdwarf_get_CHILDREN_name()\fP

As a flag value this is not quite correct (any non-zero value means
yes) but dealing with this is left up to client code (normally

Returns a frame code name  through the \f(CWs_out\fP pointer.
These are dependent on the particular ABI, so unless the

.H 2 "Section Operations"
In checking DWARF in linkonce sections for correctness
it has been found useful to have certain section-oriented
operations when processing object files.
Normally these operations are not needed or useful
in a fully-linked executable or shared library.

While the code is written with Elf sections in mind,
it is quite possible to process  non-Elf objects
with code that implements certain function pointers
(see \f(CWstruct Dwarf_Obj_Access_interface_s\fP).

So far no one with such non-elf code has come forward
to open-source it.

.H 3 "dwarf_get_section_count()"

\f(CWint dwarf_get_section_info_by_name(
   const char *section_name,
   Dwarf_Addr *section_addr,
   Dwarf_Unsigned *section_size,
   Dwarf_Error *error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_get_section_info_by_name()\fP
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP if the section given by \f(CWsection_name\fP
was seen by libdwarf.
On success it sets \f(CW*section_addr\fP to the virtual address
assigned to the section by the linker or compiler and \f(CW*section_size\fP
to the size of the object section.

It returns DW_DLV_ERROR on error.
.H 3 "dwarf_get_section_info_by_index()"

\f(CWsection_index\fP
was seen by libdwarf.
\f(CW*section_addr\fP to the virtual address
assigned to the section by the linker or compiler
and \f(CW*section_size\fP
to the size of the object section.

No free or deallocate of information returned should be done by
callers.

.H 2 "Utility Operations"
These functions aid in the management of errors encountered when using
functions in the \fIlibdwarf\fP library and releasing memory allocated
as a result of a \fIlibdwarf\fP operation.
.P
For clients that wish to encode LEB numbers two
interfaces are provided to the producer code's
internal LEB function.

.H 3 "dwarf_errno()"
.DS
\f(CWDwarf_Unsigned dwarf_errno(
    Dwarf_Error error)\fP
.DE
The function
\f(CWdwarf_errno()\fP returns the error number corresponding
to the error specified by
\f(CWerror\fP.

.H 3 "dwarf_errmsg()"
.DS
\f(CWconst char* dwarf_errmsg(
    Dwarf_Error error)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_errmsg()\fP returns a pointer to a
null-terminated error message string
corresponding to the error specified by
\f(CWerror\fP.
The string
should not be deallocated using \f(CWdwarf_dealloc()\fP.

The string should be considered to be a temporary string.
That is, the returned pointer may become stale if you do
libdwarf calls on the
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP
instance
other than
\f(CWdwarf_errmsg()\fP
or
\f(CWdwarf_errno()\fP.
So copy the errmsg string ( or print
it) but do not depend on the pointer remaining valid
past other libdwarf calls to the
\f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP instance that detected an error.

.H 3 "dwarf_errmsg_by_number()"
.DS
\f(CWconst char* dwarf_errmsg_by_number(
    Dwarf_Unside errcode)\fP
.DE
The function 
\f(CWdwarf_errmsg_by_number()\fP returns a pointer to a
null-terminated error message string
corresponding to the error number specified by
\f(CWerrcode\fP.
The string
should not be deallocated or freed.
If the 
\f(CWerrcode\fP
is too large for the table of static error strings
a string reflecting that fact is returned.
.P
For some places in the code a 
\f(CWDwarf_Error()\fP
is inconvenient and this function
lets dwarfdump report better information
in those cases.

Function new December 19, 2018.

.H 3 "dwarf_get_endian_copy_function()"
.DS
\f(CWvoid (*dwarf_get_endian_copy_function(Dwarf_Debug /*dbg*/))
    (void *, const void * /*src*/, unsigned long /*srclen*/)\fP
.DE
When reader client code wants to extract endian-dependent
integers from dwarf and the existing interfaces won't do
that (for example in printing frame instructions as
done by dwarfdump) 
\f(CWdwarf_get_endian_copy_function\fP
helps by returning the proper copy function
needed, the one libdwarf itself uses.
The client code needs a bit of glue to finish the job,
as demonstrated by the ASNAR macro in 
dwarfdump/print_frames.c
.P
On success this returns a pointer to the correct copy function.
.P
On failure it returns the null pointer.
It's up to the client code to decide how to deal
with the situation.
In no reasonable case will the null pointer be returned.
.P
New December 2018.

.H 3 "dwarf_get_harmless_error_list()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_get_harmless_error_list(Dwarf_Debug dbg,
    unsigned  count,
    const char ** errmsg_ptrs_array,
    unsigned * newerr_count);\fP
.DE
The harmless errors are not denoted by error returns from
the other libdwarf functions.  Instead, this function
returns strings of any harmless errors that have been
seen in the current object.  Clients never need call this, but
if a client wishes to report any such errors it may call.

Only a fixed number of harmless errors are recorded. It
is a circular list, so if more than the current maximum
is encountered older harmless error messages are lost.

The caller passes in a pointer to an array of pointer-to-char
as the argument \f(CWerrmsg_ptrs_array\fP.  The caller
must provide this array, libdwarf does not provide it.
The caller need not initialize the array elements.

The caller passes in the number of elements of the array of
pointer-to-char thru \f(CWcount\fP.   Since the

If there are no unreported harmless errors the function
returns \f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP and the function arguments
are ignored.
Otherwise the function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
and uses the arguments.

\f(CWlibdwarf\fP assigns error strings to the errmsg_ptrs_array.
The MININUM(count-1, number of messages recorded) pointers are assigned
to the array.  The array is terminated with a NULL pointer.
(That is, one array entry is reserved for a NULL pointer).
So if \f(CWcount\fP is 5 up to 4 strings may be returned through
the array, and one array entry is set to NULL.

Because the list is circular and messages may have been dropped
the function also returns the actual error count of harmless
errors encountered through \f(CWnewerr_count\fP
(unless the argument is NULL, in which case it is ignored).

Each call to this function resets the circular error buffer and
the error count.
So think of this call as reporting harmless errors since the
last call to it.

The pointers returned through \f(CWerrmsg_ptrs_array\fP
are only valid till the next call to libdwarf.
Do not save the pointers, they become invalid.  Copy the strings
if you wish to save them.

Calling this function neither allocates any space in memory nor
frees any space in memory.


.H 3 "dwarf_insert_harmless_error()"
.DS
void dwarf_insert_harmless_error(Dwarf_Debug dbg,
    char * newerror);
.DE
This function is used to test
\f(CWdwarf_get_harmless_error_list\fP. It simply adds
a harmless error string.
There is little reason client code should use this function.
It exists so that the harmless error functions can be
easily tested for correctness and leaks.

.H 3 "dwarf_set_harmless_error_list_size()"
.DS
\f(CWunsigned dwarf_set_harmless_error_list_size(Dwarf_Debug dbg,
    unsigned maxcount)\fP
.DE
\f(CWdwarf_set_harmless_error_list_size\fP returns the
number of harmless error strings the library is currently
set to hold.
If \f(CWmaxcount\fP is non-zero the library changes the
maximum it will record to be \f(CWmaxcount\fP.

It is extremely unwise to make \f(CWmaxcount\fP large because
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP allocates space for \f(CWmaxcount\fP
strings immediately.

.P
The set of errors
enumerated in Figure \n(aX below were defined in Dwarf 1.
These errors are not used by the \f(CWlibdwarf\fP implementation
for Dwarf 2 or later.

This list of errors is not complete;
additional errors have been added.
Some of the above errors may be unused.
Errors may not have the same meaning in different releases.
Since most error codes are returned from only one  place
(or a very small number of places) in the source
it is normally very useful to simply search the
\f(CWlibdwarf\fP source to find
out where a particular error code is generated.
See 
\f(CWlibdwarf/dwarf_errmsg_list.h\fP
for the complete message set with short descriptions.

.H 3 "dwarf_dealloc()"
.DS
\f(CWvoid dwarf_dealloc(
    Dwarf_Debug dbg,
    void* space,
    Dwarf_Unsigned type)\fP
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_dealloc\fP frees the dynamic storage pointed
to by \f(CWspace\fP, and allocated to the given \f(CWDwarf_Debug\fP.
The argument
\f(CWtype\fP is an integer code that specifies the allocation
type of the region pointed to by the \f(CWspace\fP.  Refer to section
4 for details on \fIlibdwarf\fP memory management.

.H 3 "dwarf_encode_leb128()"
.DS
int dwarf_encode_leb128(Dwarf_Unsigned val,
    int * nbytes,
    char * space,
    int   splen);
.DE
The function \f(CWdwarf_encode_leb128\fP
encodes the value \f(CWval\fP
in the caller-provided buffer that \f(CWspace\fP
points to.  The caller-provided buffer must
be at least \f(CWsplen\fP bytes long.

The function returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP
if the encoding succeeds.
If  \f(CWsplen\fP is too small to encode the
value, \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP will
be returned.

If the call succeeds,
the number of bytes of \f(CWspace\fP that are used
in the encoding are returned through the pointer \f(CWnbytes\fP


.H 3 "dwarf_encode_signed_leb128()"
.DS
int dwarf_encode_signed_leb128(Dwarf_Signed val,
    int * nbytes,
    char * space,
    int splen);
.DE

The function \f(CWdwarf_encode_signed_leb128\fP
is the same as \f(CWdwarf_encode_leb128\fP except that
the argument  
\f(CWval\fP 
is signed.

.H 2 "Finding Memory Leaks"
\f(CW
\fP 
If you are using
\f(CWdwarf_set_de_alloc_flag(0)\fP 
to turn off the garbage collection
\f(CWdwarfinish()\fP 
does and you find memory leaks there
are a couple specific tools provided
that may ease the process of tracking down
the errors you have made.
.P
This chapter is new as of 26 March 2020.
.H 3 "Compiling libdwarf -DDEBUG=1"
.P
The first tool is to build libdwarf with
options
\f(CW-g -O0 -DDEBUG=1\fP.
The -O0 is simply to help a debugger,
valgrind or other too identify source lines accurately.
The
\f(CW-DDEBUG=1\fP
Turns on printf statements in 
dwarf_alloc.c
and
dwarf_error.c
that emit lines like
.DS
libdwarfdetector ALLOC ret 0x... size 
libdwarfdetector DEALLOC ret 0x... size  
libdwarfdetector ALLOC creating error string
libdwarfdetector DEALLOC Now destruct error string 
.DE
at each point of particular interest.
.P
The first two relate to actually malloc/free.
The ret 0x...  will be a hex address of
the pointer yuur code is presented for allocations
inside libdwarf.
.P
The second two relate to allocation/free
of a string in Dwarf_Error record 
when an error record with variable 
descriptive error information is being built/freed.
.P
.H 3 "Making use of the output of -DDEBUG=1"
A small Python 3 program (alloctrack.py) in the libdwarf
regressiontests on SourceForge.net
will read through a file with libdwarfdetector
lines and report on mismatches in the alloc/dealloc
counts for each memory-blob libdwarf created.
All other lines are skipped.
.P
This has been found very useful.
.P
Since the regression tests are large
and you won't otherwise need them
a copy of alloctrack.py follows so
you need not clone the test code.
