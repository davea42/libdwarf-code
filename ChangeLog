    commit 73b5193322832def08aa88447825def649fb52e8

    The printf here do not mention the executable name now.
    We don't need the name of dwarfdump anyway,
    and this keeps the baselines simple, not having to
    realize dwarfdump.O is the same ( in the sense
    of comparing baseline text) as dwarfdump.
    See libdwarf-regressiontests for the tests involved.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/dwarfdump.c

    Ensure that at least _dwarf_flush_static_error_list()
    gets called on dwarf_finish(), even if the Dwarf_Debug
    passed in is NULL.  In case of a badly corrupted object
    this lets us avoid a 'possible leak' as valgrind calls it.

    Small changes to ensure that if memory runs out

    commit 02b03b7da78d1789023d4bc134199297d150c7ce

    Clang discovered a mistake in a usage message
    set of strings. It did not affect correctness,
    but it did provoke a clang 13.0.0 warning
    so the build stopped.

    commit b0784a81000fe592fafd97c77f82971ddb036e44

    To avoid warnings from a new compiler
    (warnings seen now for the first time) we remove
    some C with undefined meaning such as

    headdepth = head->llink - (struct ts_entry *)0;

    See ISO C 1990 section 6.3.6.

    We add a specific field to count the balanced tree depth instead
    of using strange pointer arithmetic on llink.
    No need for pointer arithmetic at all.
    There is a better way to do this using a HEAD
    separate struct and a pointer-to an rlink field
    as that would reduce struct size here,
    but we are postponing that for now.

    commit 938175b113897ede284120521f953d9476651ff9

    The dwarfdumpPE,Macos,Elf test set
    did not work with cmake as msys2 was
    not able to use the introductory #line
    to derive the script program to run
    the python.  So now we name python3
    and Linux and msys2 work for these tests.
            modified:   test/CMakeLists.txt

    Added a little bit of testing host_os to drop
    'debuglinktest-a.sh' and 'debuglinktest-b.sh'
    from ninja test as getting the Windows output
    to match Unix/Linux baseline files to
    match Windows environmengs is ...not working.

2022-08-15:  David Anderson
    commit 00c79fc290777061042d72d52099539c264b1011

    This is for regression testing to attempt to
    make Windows paths look like Unix paths
    so we can have a single baseline for all
    OS's.
    Note that it's not *really* working right yet
    so  for Windows the two actual tests (debuglink)
    are not run.
    The msys2 vs Windows paths combined with what
    dwdebuglink does with paths makes sort of a mess...

    Now uses the new python code for
    helping allow identity to baselines checking
    just like test/debuglinktest-a.sh does.
    Was an oversight this was not done earlier.

    +                for (c = *lp ; c && isinset(ap+1,c); c = *lp)

    Again VS C: A previous refactoring left an extra

    A few cases of main having  unused argc/argv

    following the main return to avoid an unused argument warning.
    Now these use main(void) and those argv/argc mentions

    Changed unsigned long to size_t
    as a recent Windows compiler warns about a
    conversion to long from a wider type.
    One applauds the compiler writer's advances in
    making code safer, but it does make for a bit of
    source adjustment from time to time.

2022-05-30:  David Anderson
    commit 1084a3be38a5e0ecec8b00498efabd9f2723e92d

    Updated error message related to DW202205-001
    and fixed odd logic and it changed
    -v --print-pubnames output! Which has been
    incorrct in one field for many years.
    The field is very not important it's really to help
    understand the byte layout of .debug_pub[names,types].
    So, old bug corrected and new error message made
    much more understandable.

    commit 6af6e566ae71b585659484e7be7cbab83dd770fb

    These are all to make msys2 pass.
    In that case, for now, we suppress the debuglink
    tests in make check
    Add new HAVE_DEBUGLINK so we can turn off the pair
    of debuglink tests in test/Makefile.am
            modified:   configure.ac
            modified:   test/Makefile.am

    commit d41a75b358fb73a44d0936fd8846b37184a537ce

    Simplfied and clarified the run oof the dwarfdump
    check scripts.
    To run each,
    a) be in the test build directory
    b) set the only argument to these script to be the source direcory
       base OR set env var DWTOPSRCDIR to the source directory base.
       Doing both is not useful, the argument will override the env var.

    commit 990a9ef4e03e3a1e4ccb10b76d19a11a7de10e0b

    We can now read and print all the data in .debug_names.

    Some functions aimed at easier use for some specific
    purposes will surely be needed soon.

    The new functions for .debug_names not yet documented.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.c

    Some of the formatting will surely need some changes,

    commit 3cc3cc3b8cfa9602e44efd111bb944cfa5ef76e0

    Now Dwarf_Debug_s has an initial field of a
    number, which is set to a hex value as
    the Dwarf_Debug is being constructed. On
    deallocation the value is reset to zero.
    In addition, random Dwarf_Debug pointers
    are checked to ensure the special value is present,
    and if not present an error is thrown.

    commit 789cecbe636c62c28c5e0ecfb75e5284cbf71e4d

    DO NOT USE THIS COMMIT.
    It adds new debug_names output, but is quite incomplete
    and...maybe ugly so far.

    commit f78b8580cb49573c1a2ca69d623cf00b7b141b23

    Revert dwarf_get_location_op_value_d() to
    dwarf_get_location_op_value_c()
    as the older version does all that is useful.
    The three arguments missing from
    dwarf_get_location_op_value_c() turned out
    to be useless.

    The newer (and now removed) dwarf_get_location_op_value_d()
    was added 2020-06-09.

    Documenting the change.

    commit adb94559b060f37d95ebdec96cc6c74a4303d83b

    Revised the handling of PE SizeOfRawData
    and VirtualSize object section fields
    so it skips processing sections it knows
    are irrelevant to dwarf.
    The way VirtualSize is used means it is
    impossible to write a precise size bound
    so we added a couple heuristics
    to prevent corrupted objects from
    causing crashes.

    commit fd4e1fd4f67f55a52b0495a27f4b64ed8a257e6b

    Added a sort after tar -tf because in Freebsd 13
    64bit tar sometimes reports files in a different order.
    Causing a misleading miscompare.
    So we sort the output of tar -tf so if the lists
    are the same we pass.

    commit de3fe09c864cef1262e73e3243c87e651cb7b5fc

    Removed use of HAVE_STDLIB_H and HAVE_STRING_H
    and HAVE_STDDEF_H everwhere as these are in
    c90 and we assume c90.
    the dwarf_names.c changes are about removing irrelevant
    (and unusable) DWARF_FRAME names in dwarf.h.
    DW_FRAME_RA_COL DW_FRAME_STATIC_LINK DW_FRAME_CFA_COL
    which had to do with SGI/IRIX use and are not used
    anywhere in libdwarf or libdwarfp.

    Trivial issues with configure.
            modified:   configure.ac

    Lots of places still had #ifdef HAVE_STDLIB_H
    which was a problem for cmake.
    And we do not need HAVE_STDLIB_H or HAVE_STRING_H
    or HAVE_STDDEF_H any longer, they are standard
    C90.

        Deleted dwarf_compress_integer_block()
        as it was meant to be removed earlier.
        No code in libdwarfp uses DW_DLV_NOCOUNT,
        DW_DLV_BADADDR or DW_DLV_BADOFFSET.
        None of this could have been useful in any case,
        it dealt with non-standard integer block compression.

            new file:   Doxyfile
        Found some typedefs and a struct here
        that are no longer used anywere, so removed
        from libdwarf.h
        Plus adding doxygen commands.
