    commit cc343150beab8de77ae28c493ce8a83db152bda3

    A compiler used R_386_GOTOFF for a relocation
    for DWARF data.
    Now that relocation is handled.

    If e_shoff is zero we immediately declare there
    is nothing here for DWARF and DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY
    is returned.  Consistent with the generic Elf ABI
    documentation.
    No further checking for Elf corruption
    or anything else is done.

    commit f83ca35f17336f8723aebacc167793d71c0f723e

    We now recognize a Mach-o object file (as opposed
    to a DSYM) and just treating that slighly differently
    lets libdwarf show the DWARF content.
    (Because, unlike DSYM, an object file has both
    executable code and DWARF data and a slight difference
    in how certain names appear)

    Reversed the order of two lines to preserve

    overlapping DW_TAG_lo_user  is a beter choice
    than DW_TAG_TI_far_type to show.

    commit 4f4e51dfb234bad27d9adb9338555e578ca4f340

    Documenting the new command to turn off access
    to decompression libraries for a build of libdwarf.

    meson
    To build a libdwarf that does not refer to or link with
    decompression libraries zstd or zlib, add the meson
    option  "-Ddecompression=false"

    configure
    As of version 0.9.1 the configure option
    "--disable-decompression" tells the build to compile
    libdwarf and dwarfdump with no reference to the zlib or
    zstd libraries.

    cmake
    To turn off linking with or using zlib or zstd libraries
    or headers there is an option to cmake add the cmake
    option DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO.

    commit dafb9bc45af0b918ff80ab668617f73c9f5778d7

    With cmake option -DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO

    to zlib.h or zstd.h or the respective libraries.

    commit 82214ba96ba9c6a02c5584fd1dd8803f71760bed

    Now passing --disable-decompression to configure
    turns off access to libz and zstd,
    which is of use to some not expecting
    to see compressed sections and missing
    libz or zstd.

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 89604291e005b1b81efee9a11742edb6443cbedb

    Now we define -Ddecompression=YES
    as the default and library builders can
    pass -Ddecompression=NO to the meson
    command to turn off decompression and
    avoid any dependency on libz or zstd.

    Fixed a bug which would result in
    a compile failure referencing includes
    for libz.h and zstd.h if one had neither.
    Doing set10('LIBZ_H',false) in meson
    has the wrong effect, as LIBZ_H gets defined 0
    so #ifdef LIBZ_H
    finds LIBZ_H is defined.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022. 

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.
