    commit 713a4060556e76adf21b47ff705df686767f2ff4

    Now produces,on stdout, a new list of the
    names that have duplicate values (we only
    retain one for dwarfdump-naming purposes,
    as via dwarf_get_AT_name() etc).
    I reviewed the list and found a couple
    instances  we
    were genering correctly but not choosing
    the best name where there are multiple.
            modified:   src/bin/gennames/gennames.c

    Alter the order in a couple places so the right
    name shows up from gennames.c

    commit 15adc9cbecefd79d28d7d82bf458cde654ac32c0

    Split two lines to avoid violating codingstyle.

    Left one line too long as it is a web reference
    so splitting it will make it wrong.

    commit 2930f3121ee6b07da405103934c329bbeca0382f

    Adding DW202403-001 ossfuzz id: 67490
            modified:   data.txt

    A carefully corrupted line table
    header can cause libdwarf to read outside of its
    allowed areas in a .debug_line section reading
    the file names part of the header.
    The failure to check for end-of-section following the
    very last byte in section has been present for many years.

    DW_FORM_block1 was not checking to ensure the
    pointer pointed inside the section.
    Similar to the vulnerability in DW202402-001 (oss fuzz 66646)
    which was about DW_FORM_ref1.
    Now it checks.

    Fixing ossfuzz 66646. A vulnerability when

    See libdwarf vulnerability

    Splitting lseek() and read() code into

    Change all types locally to be libdwarf types,

    We now recognize a Mach-o object file (as opposed

    lets libdwarf show the DWARF content.

    executable code and DWARF data and a slight difference
    in how certain names appear)

    commit 4f4e51dfb234bad27d9adb9338555e578ca4f340

    Documenting the new command to turn off access
    to decompression libraries for a build of libdwarf.

    meson
    To build a libdwarf that does not refer to or link with
    decompression libraries zstd or zlib, add the meson
    option  "-Ddecompression=false"

    configure
    As of version 0.9.1 the configure option
    "--disable-decompression" tells the build to compile
    libdwarf and dwarfdump with no reference to the zlib or
    zstd libraries.

    cmake
    To turn off linking with or using zlib or zstd libraries
    or headers there is an option to cmake add the cmake
    option DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO.

    Now passing --disable-decompression to configure
    turns off access to libz and zstd,
    which is of use to some not expecting
    to see compressed sections and missing
    libz or zstd.

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 89604291e005b1b81efee9a11742edb6443cbedb

    Now we define -Ddecompression=YES
    as the default and library builders can
    pass -Ddecompression=NO to the meson
    command to turn off decompression and
    avoid any dependency on libz or zstd.

    Fixed a bug which would result in
    a compile failure referencing includes
    for libz.h and zstd.h if one had neither.
    Doing set10('LIBZ_H',false) in meson
    has the wrong effect, as LIBZ_H gets defined 0
    so #ifdef LIBZ_H
    finds LIBZ_H is defined.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022.

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

2024-01-09:  David Anderson
    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.
