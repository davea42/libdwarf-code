    commit 165ab8d2588ad3f64c2ca8d6ccd629710c873f51

    Now for dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value() and similar
    check the Dwarf_Debug argument is non-null and
    a real (not pointing to a zeroed structure) pointer.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.c
    Added new field in Dwarf_Debug so after a change
    to the frame rule etc settings the next access to
    frame data will check that these settings are
    an acceptable combination, else it will
    return DW_DLV_ERROR.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_opaque.h
    Mention that a null Dwarf_Debug argument will
    cause these little functions to return zero
    as the 'previous' value in doxygen comments.

    commit f5b5429ac5bf58e20943da45043284043aefd7a3

    Ensure that all initial entrances to reading Frame data
    call _dwarf_validate_register_numbers() early on
    to be sure that table sizes and same-value etc
    follow the rules.
    A couple cases this was not done before now.

    commit 78060b72a06fb5fa3cfd9731ec8736689fade804

    Now dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value() interprets
    dw_value argument as meaning 'just return current value,
    do not change the initial value setting'.
    It was an ommission to fail to do this days ago.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.c

    Now dwarf_iterate_fde_all_regs3() calls
    _dwarf_validate_register_numbers() so we return error
    rather than try to run frame data with bogus
    user settings of frame register defaults.

    etc to make the functions easier to use when just
    getting the current value.

    commit 84511baec5d26856914476d23645c247eff2a72c

    This is used in 'make rebuild' to create C source
    for libdwarf based on information read from dwarf.h
    and libdwarf.h.  In a Cross-build to Arm ABI the compiler
    warned of careless comparison of signed to unsigned.
    Fixed now with completely safe (in
    this context) cast to signed long.

    commit 807f61c7b954acdff6dfca92f06d3571ff934a0b

    Added #if 0 code used for debugging
    Add fde->fd_have_fde_frame_tab = FALSE; multiple places
    Add _dwarf_empty_frame_table() call one place.

    This fixes oss fuzz 475582650 which was a memory leak
    created in code changed 12 January 2026 (ie, 6 days ago).
    That change was a major performance enhancement in
    reading Frame sections (.debug_frame and .eh_frame).

        Aside from a memory leak when suppressing
        dwarfdump --suppress-de-alloc-tree
        this works well.
