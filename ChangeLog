    bytes of command data.
    Some corrupted Mach-o objects  have garbage values
    so the maximim is useful.

    We need to check for add and multiply overflows everwhere (even in
    simply reading object files).
    These issues arrive in corrupt object files, and we
    want to catch all such.
    Now the _dwarf_uint64_mult is easily used everywhere in libdwarf.
    And _dwarf_uint64_add() is easily used everywhere in libdwarf.

    Split out src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_64machoread.c so the
    *64() functions in dwarf_64machoread.c
    and the *32() functions in dwarf_machoread.c
    This makes it easy to see that 32bit and 64bit source
    is properly equivalent (bring up each an an editor to
    see this).

    commit 9c638a21357279b9e4b1ee0c4ff7a128c3f1632e

    Defining (documenting) two existing Segment names.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_macho_loader.h

    To find corrupted Mach-o objects we are using segment
    and section names as a kind of proxy.
    We validate segment names against a known list
    and we validate section names by ensuring they
    are plain ascii.
    All these names are defined by an ABI or by the
    compiler-writers for the ABI.

    This fixes oss fuzz 446726229 (a.k.a DW202509-002)
    which was unprepared for this sort of corruption,
    starting from the initial handling of Mach-o
    objects in 2018.

    without actually loading the section.

    commit f8eda5e03cc549963b21ac99123c006abc928cec

    On Macos, certain extensions of
    the standard attributes for DW_TAG_compile_unit
    DW_AT_LLVM_sysroot and DW_AT_APPLE_sdk
    as well as identifying DW_AT_LLVM_sysroot
    being of DW_FORM_CLASS_STRING
    are now in use.
    Regenerated the .h files to match
    so -ka does not issue warnings on seeing these now-normal
    items.

    Whether we use cmake target_compile_definitions

    commit da649ae15c061ad51e7b1248f8e32cafdc0aeab8

     Changes to be committed:
    Implements a new dwarfdump option:
       '--print-language-version-table'

    which prints the DWARF6 specified values
    related to DW_AT_language_version.
    It prints the available values as specified in
    www.dwarfstd.org , not the usage of such in an object file.

    Dwarfdump automatically reports all the details
    when reporting DW_AT_language_name and
    DW_AT_language_version attributes, no special options required.

2025-07-07:  MrSmör
    commit 6a0ace2b192bd0e3b6c9bb465685280c5e85db8d

    Make meson generate a proper pkg-config file when absolute paths (#298)
    are specified for includedir and libdir etc.

    Showing just one example, the other two lines
    are equivalent
    Prefix and @0@ are in the output so if @0@ is full path
    it does not work, as it has mixed full paths onto prefix.

    -pkgconf.set('libdir', '${prefix}/@0@'.format(get_option('libdir')))

    A full path in @0@ means (via join_paths) that
    the prefix gets dropped (that is, path joining
    works sensibly).
    +pkgconf.set('libdir', join_paths('${prefix}','@0@'.format(get_option('libdir'))))

    commit f2c38c0138c6e296cefb3e39024b8fe350f00bff

    Added a new option to dwarfgen that tells it
    to emit DW_AT_language_name and DW_AT_language_version
    to the output object if they are not already present.
    Needed for testing the handling of those DWARF6
    attributes.

    commit 1ff164059b46b630d05c93a1a44ab8f955ee7b77

    Simplification of the fix to github Issue 293.
    On current MacOS (as with MSYS2) we need a
       target_link_libraries(dwarfp PRIVATE dwarf)
    when building shared libdwarfp
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarfp/CMakeLists.txt

2025-05-31:  David Anderson
    commit 1c233af544f82acdcf6d1a63acf5cc9a7c660a15

    Now all the builds request dwarfgen build too.
    Just for completeness, not because it's necessary
    (except for running full regression tests).
            modified:   scripts/allsimplebuilds.sh

2025-05-30:  David Anderson
    commit ebb64d792278b8f2656e465b7676daa3b5ebd37c

    github Issue 293: cmake building dwarfgen and libdwarfp
    failed.
    The file failed to include three libdwarf files that
    needed to be compiled here to expose hidden libdwarf
    objects (to the libdwarfp context)
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_memcpy_swap.c
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_string.c
    +../libdwarf/dwarf_tsearchhash.c

    In addition added
    +if(MINGW OR MSYS OR WIN32)
    +    target_link_libraries(dwarfp PRIVATE dwarf)
    +endif()
    In 1ff164059b46b630d05c93a1a44ab8f955ee7b77 above
    simplified to just
    + target_link_libraries(dwarfp PRIVATE dwarf)

    Plus, revised the compiler flags settings to make this
    as much like the libdwarf CMakeLists.txt as possible:
     if (BUILD_SHARED)
    -    set(COMPILER_FLAGS -DLIBDWARF_BUILD -DPIC)
    +    if(NOT BUILD_DWARFGEN)
    +      set(CMAKE_C_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
    +    endif()
    +    set(DEFS LIBDWARF_BUILD PIC)
     else()
    -    set(COMPILER_FLAGS -DLIBDWARF_STATIC)
    +    set(DEFS LIBDWARF_STATIC)
     endif()
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarfp/CMakeLists.txt

    Now we can build shared-library libdwarfp-2.dll on
    msys2.

    commit 2640238cc0a9a41507830b83546ce26f38196471

    The heuristics trying to identify a bogus

            modified:   doc/libdwarf.dox
    Improved error reports and created a new local function

    Added fuller explanation of the use of
    shell envronment variable 'DWARF_WHICH_ALLOC'
    to influence the use of malloc() vs mmap().
    mmap() is only usable (in this release) on Elf
    object files.

    commit 08ff7580f0afe0ea9b4ba61092cc545512e4360e

    On linux gdb and valgrind  and libc notice
    that printf of sequential byte pairs, where
    the byte-pairs accidentally overlap (!) due
    to a mistake in this source... is bogus.

    MacOS notices too, but it reports "Trace/BPT trap: 5"
    which is quite mysterious.
    This is a serious bug which has been in place
    since support for the DWARF5 .debug_names section
    was added.  It crashes the app reading the .debug_info
    section reliably.

    Of course simplereader is just an example, but
    still...needs to be correct

    It had been hidden from testing before due to an oversight in
    the  debugfissionb directory in regressiontests
    was coded. We now prevent corrupt
    DWARF with duplicated attributes in a PE file from
    showing an error and avoiding
    any meaingful test. Just for this case.
    So the tests are now fixed too.

    commit ad7d97b0434757cb3f43b77e0c322ae5005af9cf

    Added and documented
    dwarf_language_version_string()
    to the API so programs can interpret the
    version (as an integer) in detail should
    they wish to do so.

    The intent is the actual version is an integer
    and trivial to compare.  It's possible
    (though highly unlikely) that a real version
    might not be representable directly.
    DW_AT_language_version is a DWARF class CONSTANT,
    not a string.

    commit 43831b87e10e1e2503b625611ab66e00e256e4aa

    This completes the work for release 0.12.0
    (release date not yet scheduled) which enables
    use of mmap or malloc/read when libdwarf
    accesses object section data.

    A major compatibility break requiring
    code calling the library be recompiled with
    the new library.

    Systems without the functions/data to use mmap
    will compile normally, though the compatibility
    break is still applicable.

    Small changes may be required before release.

    Normal automatic update.

    commit 1295c345a7990f6600df56ff22f9db41e1a51efd

    Now handles unmap and record keeping
    for using mmap instead of malloc/read on section content.
    Nothing here yet for mapping or choices of which
    to use.

    commit 304e3b74896c4010fdddcb3ba9fd1f60a4f8c765

    For large sections (like .debug_info) avoid preloading the
    hash table recording allocation with a gigantic
    allocation.  If necessary it will later increase
    the allocation automatically.

    commit ed74b438dcbbf74759a15324c93d924191823ea7

    As of 6 January 2025 the DWARF committee
    voted to make W_AT_language_name
    and DW_AT_language_version from DWARF6
    immutable values now.  So compilers wishing
    to add either or both to DWARF5
    compiler output are officially allowed to use
    these now.
