    commit 365189647067c0c4e1f85c05838d50fc8c8f1408

    First use of this testcase today.
    The testcase emitted one printf string
    which had no ending newline.
    That provoked a warning from diff
    which looked ugly.
    So I added a terminating newline to the one and only printf
    in the code.

    commit 7fb14fea73b899cf5ceb04749a9ebdd8a199ca31

    An aid to certain debugging tasks.

    Now include dwarf_local_malloc.h everywhere so
    when it's useful all the usual (malloc calloc
    realloc free) are defined to call into
    dwarf_local_malloc.h and tracked there to
    help debug failures to use a sensible size malloc (etc).
    When LIBDWARF_MALLOC  is set by CPPFLAGS  for
    a special build this is effective and there are
    printf's emitted from libdwarf.

    No normal build sets that CPPFLAG value and
    when not set the new functions in dwarf_local_malloc.?
    are invisible to the libdwarf build.

    commit e69eb5da569ce8d3a76ac1aa2f1ae9d371729dbf

    The test code fuzz/fuzz_die_cu_attrs.c  fails to test library
    return codes in a loop and runs an unreasonably long time.
    It's not an infinite loop, but memory is accumulating
    pretty fast.
    Results in megabytes of useless error messages from libdwarf.
    I have changed the test source to check for a null 'attr'
    and stop the loop right away. With a short message.

    A field in a PE object file with the size to be malloc'd
    was not checked for sanity before trying
    to load the section into memory. So the fuzzed test case
    resulted in a 1.7GB malloc.
    Now we reject as a error.

    commit 963e0392dd33c7314325ea37269addc18f19336e

    A set of changes reflecting corrections following
    a detailed review of  the handling of  and
    correct interpretation of .debug_rnglists
    and .debug_loclists data.
    Some errors (not affecting correctness, thankfully)
    were present.

    Removing a now-unused argument from
    _dwarf_next_cu_header_internal()
    and refinement of the test for entry_pc with
    if (entry_pc_attrnum >= 0 &&
           cucon->cc_producer == CC_PROD_Apple)
    And rearrangement of the DW_AT_low_pc vs
    DW_AT_entry_pc (Apple only) checks
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c

    Mainly debug printouts and preparation for
    a validity check of data read from a DWARF section.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loclists.c
    Added CC_PROD_Apple for sharpened handling of
    DW_AT_entry_pc.
    And new internal function _dwarf_entrypc()
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_opaque.h

    Refactoring
    Now dwarf_lowpc() and the new _dwarf_entrypc()
    use the same implementation code.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_query.c

    Lots of ifdefed-out debug printf (to be removed pretty soon)
    and crucial correction of _dwarf_determine_die_range_offset()
    to get 'base address' correct.
    Leaving a superflous argument in dwarf_get_ranges_baseaddress()
    as  the function is public.
    And corrected its code returning CU base address.
    Added (void)have_die_ranges_offset; /* FIXME */
    to avoid compiler issues.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_ranges.c

    Some #if 0 code will be deleted very soon.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_rnglists.c
    Ill advised code in _dwarf_loop_reading_debug_info_for_cu()
    is now #if 0 out. To be deleted very soon.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_tied.c

    commit b608cead3f2eee17e962ca970ae5c35805bc3ebd
    Merge: 96bd4edd 721d3d82

    Merge branch 'threekey'
    Replaced much of the code generating tag/attr statistics
    from the dwarfdump -ku option.
    All these changes are in dwarfdump, none in libdwarf.

    The old  approach of generating statistics 
    left out things about non-standard
    TAGs and ATtributes as it would have been extra work
    at the time. Now, using dwarf_tsearch and building
    searchable and sortable data, additional targeted
    reports become easy to add and update.
    No doubt more will be added.

    when used in .debug_names (DWARF5) and everywhere else.

We altered the (internal) struct Dwarf_Debug_s 
with better naming for loclists rnglists fields merged
from a skeleton to the dwp/dwo.

We revised DW_DLV_ERROR reports to always use 
the main-object, not the tied-object (if any)
to report errors. Simpler and saver now we
read more from the tied-object. Made possible
by 3 new fields in dwarf_opaque.h (a libdwarf-private
header).

    Removed trailing whitespace.

    properly, we think.
    Many #ifdef TEST_MER code blocks must now be

    Contains debug related to DWARF5 rnglists.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_die.c
    Now all DW_DLV_ERROR allocations appear on
    the 'main file' errors allocations, never on the tied-file
    allocations. Simplifies dealing with reading from the tied-file.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_alloc.c
    Lots of temporary debug printf (with ifdefs).
    Small but important changes dealing with tied-file.
    Includes eliminating de_tied_data.td_tied_object.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c

    in its place.
    Removed completely an ill-advised #if 0 code block.
    Left debug printf in place (within #ifdef)

    commit e65fc8c50072f07fefd1017650c97e7282125e1d

    cmake and meson builds here defaulted to shared,
    which was not working on MacOS, possibly due to
    issues with copying libraries around (without
    the proper details for MacOS).
    So now we just default all build mechanisms
    to be static library builds.
    Works on Linux and MacOS without other changes.

    commit 3c8422df4d775a4d5ed4d7422c35688aeb05ca77

    Changed all instances of macro use s follows:
    true->TRUE
    false->FALSE
    and removed the macro defines of true(1) and false(0).
    It was really strange to have two different names
    for each idea.
    The majority of uses were spelled TRUE/FALSE already.
    The inconsistent usage was present at least as far back
    as 2016.

2024-07-30:  David Anderson
    commit b58af60787c748cfc3b1d0b1c197c6ca48d8e773

    Change the original dwarf_global_formref()
    to use the current dwarf_global_formref_b()
    so things reflect the realities of DWARF4.

    The new code about .debug_ranges had
    small leaks when the library was told
    not to record or clean-up most memory allocations.
    Shown by -fsanitize.

    Would not affect most users, but for the few
    that use the feature this fixes the issue.

    commit cf124de35867f5d18041851922cda301508e1716

    Added a Description to the project() command
    while reformatting the command a little.
    Without interfering with how the version string
    appears so tools/updatesemanticversion.py
    can still update the version when necessary.

    commit 595c9edf0e78ccc7c3803fe106ccb45299f947a6

    Now up to date, showing the final
    0.10.0 git id as well as some
    small changes in  cmake builds so that
    all three build mechanisms create
    (on install) a libdwarf.pc with a correct Version:
    value.  Cmake builds used to leave that field blank.

    commit 735137e89261c04500b3262da02fc45d0f21550c

    Cmake was not setting  Version: in the output libdwarf.pc.
    The corrections to the pc.in files required
    the tiny change to configure.ac and now
    all build mechanisms set Version: in libdwarf.pc
    and libdwarfp.pc installed by 'make install'
    and its equivalents.

    (corrected: git log says 0.19.0 which is incorrect)
    0.10.0, though this function is not something
    library users will find necessary (the
    function  enables improved dwarfdump reporting
    of DWARF5 loclists).

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d() continues to

    Revises the dwarfdump reporting of debug_rnglists to clarify

    The --print-raw-rnglists option is more useful now.

    verify DW_FORM_rnglistx DW_FORM_loclistx are valid.

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e() added to API, it returns

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d() for the benefit of dwarfdump
    reporting. Not of general interest.

    commit 8df1e989f3bf55668af09d25dd21347f01fba6d2

    Updated the output format of --print-raw-loclists
    to be more useful and to essentially match the rnglists
    version.

2024-06-05:  David Anderson
    commit f16e5b82fa5cb9feb442fdef633579e6f02e2e58

    Separated out part of loclists data structs to
    be a better match with dwarf_rnglists.h
    And added the new file so configure and cmake
    know about it. Meson takes care of this itself.

    commit b70abb30dc9fdd196be4e159078548eef9cb9050

    Corrected calculations related to rnglists array of offsets
    (were calling entries address size when they are offset size).
    Corrected handling of the 'implicit DW_AT_ranges_base'
    that can be emitted if there is just a single table
    of rnglist RLE sequences.

    With a Split Full object and its skeleton object
    the loop intended to find the relevant skeleton CU
    by a signature (Dwarf_Sig8)
    was stopping its CU loop too soon due to a bug created
    when the code was written for DWARF 5.
    So the target CU was never located.
    The loop is now correct.

            modified:   data.txt

    A carefully corrupted line table
    header can cause libdwarf to read outside of its

    the file names part of the header.
    The failure to check for end-of-section following the
    very last byte in section has been present for many years.

    commit 812f5db1c0fd4369e4c3b6bb8b132c70b6940320

    Fixing ossfuzz 66646. A vulnerability when
    reading an object with a particular corruption in
    the DWARF.  With DW_FORM_ref1 the library was
    not validating the referenced address before
    dereferencing.
    See libdwarf vulnerability
    list DW202402-001 for the details.
    This bug has been present in the library for
    many years.

    Like the previous call/recalloc changes these issues detected
    by MSVC code analysis.

    The dwarfdump ones just previous were real bugs.
    These are real bugs too.

    Check for a NULL dss_data field so a code-checking

    actually understand why it cannot be NULL.

    Now with a test for a null pointer passed in.
    There is no error return, but instead we
    simply return 0.

    We now recognize a Mach-o object file (as opposed
    to a DSYM) and just treating that slighly differently
    lets libdwarf show the DWARF content.
    (Because, unlike DSYM, an object file has both
    executable code and DWARF data and a slight difference
    in how certain names appear)

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 4f4e51dfb234bad27d9adb9338555e578ca4f340

    Documenting the new command to turn off access
    to decompression libraries for a build of libdwarf.

    meson
    To build a libdwarf that does not refer to or link with
    decompression libraries zstd or zlib, add the meson
    option  "-Ddecompression=false"

    configure
    As of version 0.9.1 the configure option
    "--disable-decompression" tells the build to compile
    libdwarf and dwarfdump with no reference to the zlib or
    zstd libraries.

    cmake
    To turn off linking with or using zlib or zstd libraries
    or headers there is an option to cmake add the cmake
    option DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO.

    commit dafb9bc45af0b918ff80ab668617f73c9f5778d7

    With cmake option -DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO

    to zlib.h or zstd.h or the respective libraries.

    commit 82214ba96ba9c6a02c5584fd1dd8803f71760bed

    Now passing --disable-decompression to configure
    turns off access to libz and zstd,
    which is of use to some not expecting
    to see compressed sections and missing
    libz or zstd.

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 89604291e005b1b81efee9a11742edb6443cbedb

    Now we define -Ddecompression=YES
    as the default and library builders can
    pass -Ddecompression=NO to the meson
    command to turn off decompression and
    avoid any dependency on libz or zstd.

    Fixed a bug which would result in
    a compile failure referencing includes
    for libz.h and zstd.h if one had neither.
    Doing set10('LIBZ_H',false) in meson
    has the wrong effect, as LIBZ_H gets defined 0
    so #ifdef LIBZ_H
    finds LIBZ_H is defined.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022.

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.
