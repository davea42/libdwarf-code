    commit 14a9f14d06ce32f3bc156e60740e1ce3d1be25b2

    The new code about .debug_ranges had
    small leaks when the library was told
    not to record or clean-up most memory allocations.
    Shown by -fsanitize.

    Would not affect most users, but for the few
    that use the feature this fixes the issue.

    commit eedcb528ef0f108b7747018073ca5ba37ef689b1

    Due to the addition of dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e()
    we revise the version for the next release to be
    (corrected: git log says 0.19.0 which is incorrect)
    0.10.0, though this function is not something
    library users will find necessary (the
    function  enables improved dwarfdump reporting
    of DWARF5 loclists).

    commit c81229cb76d865b60aff9c8b5719a282b31de946

    Doumented a new Change entry,
    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e() for the convenience of
    reporting (from dwarfdump).
    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d() continues to
    be fine to use,
    you likely don't need to see the extra field reported
    by dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e().

    Revises the dwarfdump reporting of debug_rnglists to clarify
    the dwarf 5 debug_rnglists structure content.
    The --print-raw-rnglists option is more useful now.

    These changes also make it possible (depending
    on the size of .debug_rnglists/loclists!) to
    verify DW_FORM_rnglistx DW_FORM_loclistx are valid.

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e() added to API, it returns

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d() for the benefit of dwarfdump
    reporting. Not of general interest.

    commit 113726e89a785b3adc682d9ff2b5f95345fb299a

    With a Split Full object and its skeleton object
    the loop intended to find the relevant skeleton CU
    by a signature (Dwarf_Sig8)
    was stopping its CU loop too soon due to a bug created
    when the code was written for DWARF 5.
    So the target CU was never located.
    The loop is now correct.

    Renaming  DW_DLE_PE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR

    DW_DLE_PE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR remains valid and applies
    as a hard object file error found in a

    retain one for dwarfdump-naming purposes,

    the best name where there are multiple.

            modified:   data.txt

    A carefully corrupted line table
    header can cause libdwarf to read outside of its

    the file names part of the header.
    The failure to check for end-of-section following the
    very last byte in section has been present for many years.

    leb number case is safe C with no indeterminate
    result possible.

    commit 812f5db1c0fd4369e4c3b6bb8b132c70b6940320

    Fixing ossfuzz 66646. A vulnerability when
    reading an object with a particular corruption in
    the DWARF.  With DW_FORM_ref1 the library was
    not validating the referenced address before
    dereferencing.
    See libdwarf vulnerability
    list DW202402-001 for the details.
    This bug has been present in the library for
    many years.

    commit 0c9b1fb3b1ca852f116405d82e1b08c8717dac8a

    Like the previous call/recalloc changes these issues detected
    by MSVC code analysis.

    The dwarfdump ones just previous were real bugs.
    These are real bugs too.

    Check for a NULL dss_data field so a code-checking
    system can see its checked without having to
    actually understand why it cannot be NULL.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_gdbindex.c

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_stringsection.c

    Use newlines to ensure no formatting surprise
    and count this as ERROR for the error count to be
    shown eventually.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/dd_command_options.c

    and print an ERROR message.

    commit 9a8f0f761120bbbdb1f3f9442ed67b4c84e65c44

    More messages use homefy() so regression tests
    independent of that aspect of the path of
    relevant strings.

    Now that relocation is handled.

    We now recognize a Mach-o object file (as opposed
    to a DSYM) and just treating that slighly differently
    lets libdwarf show the DWARF content.
    (Because, unlike DSYM, an object file has both
    executable code and DWARF data and a slight difference
    in how certain names appear)

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 4f4e51dfb234bad27d9adb9338555e578ca4f340

    Documenting the new command to turn off access
    to decompression libraries for a build of libdwarf.

    meson
    To build a libdwarf that does not refer to or link with
    decompression libraries zstd or zlib, add the meson
    option  "-Ddecompression=false"

    configure
    As of version 0.9.1 the configure option
    "--disable-decompression" tells the build to compile
    libdwarf and dwarfdump with no reference to the zlib or
    zstd libraries.

    cmake
    To turn off linking with or using zlib or zstd libraries
    or headers there is an option to cmake add the cmake
    option DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO.

    commit dafb9bc45af0b918ff80ab668617f73c9f5778d7

    With cmake option -DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO

    to zlib.h or zstd.h or the respective libraries.

    commit 82214ba96ba9c6a02c5584fd1dd8803f71760bed

    Now passing --disable-decompression to configure
    turns off access to libz and zstd,
    which is of use to some not expecting
    to see compressed sections and missing
    libz or zstd.

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 89604291e005b1b81efee9a11742edb6443cbedb

    Now we define -Ddecompression=YES
    as the default and library builders can
    pass -Ddecompression=NO to the meson
    command to turn off decompression and
    avoid any dependency on libz or zstd.

    Fixed a bug which would result in
    a compile failure referencing includes
    for libz.h and zstd.h if one had neither.
    Doing set10('LIBZ_H',false) in meson
    has the wrong effect, as LIBZ_H gets defined 0
    so #ifdef LIBZ_H
    finds LIBZ_H is defined.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022.

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.
