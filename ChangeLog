    commit ddd0cdc9c7fa6bab7b164a38e79d4030b53c9665

    If a read is too big, do multiple reads.
    If _WIN32 use extra casts to compile ok with VS.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022. 

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.

    Merge: 146fa5e7 5f310464

    Merge branch 'alexdenisov/add-an-option-to-disable-zlib-zstd' of https://github.com/AlexDenisov/libdwarf-code into AlexDenisov-alexdenisov/add-an-option-to-disable-zlib-zstd
    Adding option to cmake.  So zlib/libzstd ignored (if ignoring is requested)

    commit 5f310464c583682afdb0f607a864123001f181d8

    Add a CMake option to disable libz/libzstd

    Currently, the only way to disable these is to uninstall one of them
    from the system, which is not very convenient.
