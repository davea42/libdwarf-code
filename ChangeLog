    commit 13a9a4d7ebfe3b099a753ea9f2cfd84ccb4ce6b8

    This does, or shows how to do, all we do
    when making a release. Currently set
    for the release of 0.10.0
            new file:   tools/makerelease.sh

    commit eedcb528ef0f108b7747018073ca5ba37ef689b1

    Due to the addition of dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_e()
    we revise the version for the next release to be
    (corrected: git log says 0.19.0 which is incorrect)
    0.10.0, though this function is not something
    library users will find necessary (the
    function  enables improved dwarfdump reporting
    of DWARF5 loclists).

    dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d() continues to

    Revises the dwarfdump reporting of debug_rnglists to clarify

    The --print-raw-rnglists option is more useful now.

    verify DW_FORM_rnglistx DW_FORM_loclistx are valid.

    commit 6d7ca552fe91bb67c0d6cc4a785f0397fb7a0072

    Now, for DWARF4 GNU .debug_addr extension we
    create a table so we can print the raw
    section sensibly from dwarfdump.

    commit af6b8f2c380d06c2a6bc592f56592f733047ccab

    Renaming  DW_DLE_PE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR
    to  DW_DLE_PE_SECTION_SIZE_HEURISTIC_FAIL
    so any failure of the three such tests are
    clearly reported.  Should never happen.

    DW_DLE_PE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR remains valid and applies
    as a hard object file error found in a
    specific test (not a heuristic).

    commit 039569ed7903f132ad891a49a231378c6ea44077

    A heuristic sanity check on section VirtualSize
    was too concervative at s00MB, a PE object file had a section
    over 200MB in size.
    Increased the heuristic limit to 1000MB.

    Disable default werror=true in Meson manifest (#239)

    Under MSVC, `/WX` (the equivalent to `-Werror`) will cause the build to crash and burn. This makes it not default to making the build crash and burn.

    commit 713a4060556e76adf21b47ff705df686767f2ff4

    Now produces,on stdout, a new list of the
    names that have duplicate values (we only
    retain one for dwarfdump-naming purposes,
    as via dwarf_get_AT_name() etc).
    I reviewed the list and found a couple
    instances  we
    were genering correctly but not choosing
    the best name where there are multiple.

    the file names part of the header.
    The failure to check for end-of-section following the
    very last byte in section has been present for many years.

    Use newlines to ensure no formatting surprise

    shown eventually.

    On realloc check for null return and print an ERROR
    record if it is an error (but print at most once).

    On calloc() check for null return amd print an ERROR

    We now recognize a Mach-o object file (as opposed
    to a DSYM) and just treating that slighly differently
    lets libdwarf show the DWARF content.
    (Because, unlike DSYM, an object file has both
    executable code and DWARF data and a slight difference
    in how certain names appear)

2024-01-20:  David Anderson
    commit 4f4e51dfb234bad27d9adb9338555e578ca4f340

    Documenting the new command to turn off access
    to decompression libraries for a build of libdwarf.

    meson
    To build a libdwarf that does not refer to or link with
    decompression libraries zstd or zlib, add the meson
    option  "-Ddecompression=false"

    configure
    As of version 0.9.1 the configure option
    "--disable-decompression" tells the build to compile
    libdwarf and dwarfdump with no reference to the zlib or
    zstd libraries.

    cmake
    To turn off linking with or using zlib or zstd libraries
    or headers there is an option to cmake add the cmake
    option DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO.

    commit dafb9bc45af0b918ff80ab668617f73c9f5778d7

    With cmake option -DENABLE_DECOMPRESSION=NO
    libdwarf will build without any reference
    to zlib.h or zstd.h or the respective libraries.

            modified:   CMakeLists.txt

    commit 82214ba96ba9c6a02c5584fd1dd8803f71760bed

    Now passing --disable-decompression to configure
    turns off access to libz and zstd,
    which is of use to some not expecting
    to see compressed sections and missing
    libz or zstd.
            modified:   configure.ac

    commit 89604291e005b1b81efee9a11742edb6443cbedb

    Now we define -Ddecompression=YES
    as the default and library builders can
    pass -Ddecompression=NO to the meson
    command to turn off decompression and
    avoid any dependency on libz or zstd.

    Fixed a bug which would result in
    a compile failure referencing includes
    for libz.h and zstd.h if one had neither.
    Doing set10('LIBZ_H',false) in meson
    has the wrong effect, as LIBZ_H gets defined 0
    so #ifdef LIBZ_H
    finds LIBZ_H is defined.

    commit 20e6efcbde6ba8fd964cde62c0e4c5b3ee3088b9

    ifdefs for zstd.h and zlib.h were written in a
    non-obvious way. Now in standard libdwarf form for clarity.

    commit 501bf707bbf045ebaeb97f57d14f148f680f2121

    Fixing warnings (VS) about arguments to posix functions.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    This did not really fix the two warnings. There is something odd
    in the declaration of posix read() and lseek() in VS
    community edition 2022.

    The warnings complain of off_t to 'unsigned long'
    and size_t to 'unsigned int' which seems to make no sense..
    Linux and posix docs
    agree on the argument and return types and the variables
    are appropriately typed.

    commit 13cf9ff0ec8593e5bf494c4e33fd0da6b4727888

    Now we can read DWARF2 produced by an obsolete
    compiler from Metrowerks. It uses DW_FORM_ref_addr
    where it means DW_FORM_addr (DW_AT_low_pc
    for example). It sets the
    relocation section type to SHT_RELA correctly
    and then names the section with .rel (not .rela
    as it should).
    It has two .rel.debug_line sections for no reason.

    libdwarf checks the CU die DW_AT_producer string
    and notes when a CU was produced by the Metrowerks
    compiler, recording that internally for use
    in dealing with attributes and FORMs.

    Add a CMake option to disable libz/libzstd

    Currently, the only way to disable these is to uninstall one of them
    from the system, which is not very convenient.
