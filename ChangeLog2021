    commit b7864fc2b51a655863a0a59c5b70128e7b4145bb
    Author: David Anderson <davea42@linuxmail.org>
    Date:   Sun Dec 26 14:18:27 2021 -0800

        This is just a start with doxygen.
            new file:   Doxyfile
        Found some typedefs and a struct here
        that are no longer used anywere, so removed
        from libdwarf.h
        Plus adding doxygen commands.

    commit 67ca2c685feddf4c200bb03cfb9292c6d1518b00

    This completes, for now, the dwarfdump source file renaming.
    No function names were changed
    (aside from tsearch, using #define in dd_tsearch.h)
    And there is no logic change.

    commit 4d5566123c687e1f962af0f6ad14c45fc198c48a

    Correcting macros so arguments have () around
    argument use inside the macro definition.
    Added default: break; to switch statements
    for clarity to the reader.
    Slight modifications of some DW_DLV_ERROR tests
    for greater clarity.

    This eliminates all the .c warnings cobra emits
    that I think should be eliminated.

    commit 1ff4e2d7c0e79ad0579e73fe7cdec716c9fcf80d

    Clearing up some things cobra noted.

    Simplifying by unnesting if where nesting was silly
    (Involving DW_DLV_ERROR DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY).
    Ensuring macros have use of the arguments in ()
    Adding default: break; in switch statements
    without a default.
    Putting for loop control variable updates in the
    third part of the for rather than in the body.

    commit 93941b990628af67318d0ad1eb315f2bba6968b0

    When an object file is severely corrupt the library
    would sometimes emit a strange final  error
    DW_DLE_Error (0)
    following a more normal looking error.
    Now the strange one  is suppressed.

    commit 29a39c12bb818c552b1575b28ebef1a8c4089b04

    Now builds a new opscounttab which has the change in
    the size of the expression stack for each DW_OP.
    To enable the print_die.c changes.
        modified:   src/bin/buildopstab/buildopscounttab.c
        modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/opscounttab.c (regenerated)
        modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/opscounttab.h (new field added)

    Unless the expression is trivial
    printing expressions (DW_OP_swap etc)
    -v -i now adds a line like
      DW_OPs= 13 maxstackdepth= 4 endingstackdepth= 3
    at the end of the list of DW_OP expression operations
    as a shorthand for the instructions and their
    use of an expression stack.
    If there are expression loops It adds
      loopcount= <n>
    to the end of the line (counting the
    instances of a DW_OP_bra or DW_OP_skip
    in a negative direction).
        modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_die.c

    The old names of these functions were a bit
    misleading. They are for all expressions.

    commit b4ef1850a66940b70596e3db6ca3cbf7da47cd6a

    The emergency printf (which usually means
    bad behavior by libdwarf callers)
    now reports the name and number of the
    detected error instead of just
    the error number. On stderr.

    Except in one emergency case the library returns errors.
    But sometimes it has no way to do so.

    Now Rev 4.16 6 November 2021.
    Added a new document section "Private vs Public Functions"
    to make it clear only functions beginning
    with "dwarf_" are public and callable.

    If libdwarf built as an archive it is up to callers
    to not violate this rule.

    If libdwarf built as a shared object (.so or .dll)
    the build arranges that only the public functions
    can be called (using gcc/clang -fvisibility
    where applicable).

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h

    Ensure the errcode from
    dwarf_init_path_dl gets turned into a Dwarf_Error
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_generic_init.c

    Now checks the command count and sizeofcmds for
    basic sanity, catching badly corrupt objects..

    commit eb6a3535595fcb3529b8690aa5725bafe1293230

    Now reports a correct error if in process_one_file()
    detects an error, cleans up the error,
    and returns DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY
    a corrupt mach-o object file was previously not
    properly reported.

    commit 71764671216985fe7df2546a73d67566f11e5209

    Now emphasizes that dwarf_get_frame_instruction() is fine
    unless you want frame details for a Heterogenous
    Debugging object file (and in that case
    you know you need it).
            modified:   doc/libdwarf.mm

    Regenerated with version 0.3.1 as
    LLVM adds DW_CFA_LLVM_def_aspace_cfa[_sf]
    which requires the existence of a new function
    to get the third value (all previous CFA
    operators had a maxmum of 2 values).

    cannot get all three values yet,
    as the new third value is not
    visible to dwarfdump.

    commit 957442d1059130b96713b255d3b29ddd90e1a512

    Now, for the first time,
    DW_LIBDWARF_VERSION_MACRO
    DW_LIBDWARF_VERSION_MINOR
    DW_LIBDWARF_VERSION_MICRO
    and
    DW_LIBDWARF_VERSION
    are #defined.
    These have the Semantic version number.
    At present
    Macro is 0
    minor is 3
    Micro is 0
    DW_LIBDWARF_VERSION
    is defined as "0.3.0"

    These are the version defined in libdwarf.h
    when one includes it.
    No earlier libdwarf.h defined any of these.

    The function dwarf_package_version(),
    on the other hand, returns a string
    with the PACKAGE_VERSION visible
    in configure.ac and CMakeLists.txt
    at the time the library was compiled

    commit d3ba444c4e4891545552590d9d36c2049197678e

    API change here for frame (and especially
    for frame instructions)
    Extensive use of Dwarf_Block where it adds clarity.
    Removed bit-reading of frame instructions as
    thats no longer necessary, the new
    function dwarf_get_frame_instruction() does
    that for us.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_frames.c

    One internal pointer changed from Dwarf_Ptr
    to Dwarf_Small * for easier use and better type checking.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_frames.h

    frame1.c is now using the revised and new frame interfaces.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfexample/frame1.c
    createirepfrombinary.cc is doing so too now.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfgen/createirepfrombinary.cc

    Rearranged DW_CFA_nop DW_CFA_extended so the nop
    version is what is printed, not the artificial
    DW_CFA_extended (both are 0).
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf.h
    DW_DLA_FRAME_OP replaced by DW_DLA_FRAME_INSTR_HEAD
    and DW_DLA_FRAME_BLOCK has been dropped.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_alloc.c

    Fixed a comment and pointless whitespace.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.c
    Added DW_DLE_CFA_INSTRUCTION_ERROR(485)
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_errmsg_list.h

    Dropped the Dwarf_Frame_Op support.
    Now with some internal args Dwarf_Unsigned where
    Dwarf_Signed made no sense.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.c
    Dwarf_Frame_Instr_s and Dwarf_Frame_Op_List_s
    (not visible to library callers) created.
    Now with some args Dwarf_Unsigned where
    Dwarf_Signed made no sense.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame.h
    Now with some args Dwarf_Unsigned where
    Dwarf_Signed made no sense.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_frame2.c

    Removed a useless blank line.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h

    Fixed indents, trailing whitespace.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.c

    A Dwarf_Block field is no Dwarf_Byte_Ptr,
    identical to Dwarf_Small *
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.h

    Removed #if 0 #endif short sequences.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_macro.c

    'make rebuild' altered this so DW_CFA_nop can
    be returned as a cfa name string.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_names.c

    Removed trailing whitespace.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_object_detector.c

    Removed a #if 0 endif declaration of code never
    written.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_opaque.h

    Removed Dwarf_Frame_Op_s. It only ever worked
    for DWARF2.
    New opaque structs Dwarf_Frame_Instr_Head_s
    and Dwarf_Frame_Instr_s make possible
    easy and improved access to .debug_frame/.eh_frame
    DW_CFA instructions.
    Removed DW_DLA_FRAME_OP and added
    DW_DLA_FRAME_INSTR_HEAD.
    Added DW_DLE_CFA_INSTRUCTION_ERROR.
    dwarf_get_cie_info_b() and
    dwarf_get_fde_range()  and
    dwarf_get_fde_instr_bytes(()
    now use  Dwarf_Small *
    instead of Dwarf_Ptr as thats easier to use
    and slightly safer for type checking..
    Effectively unsigned char * instead of void *

    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3_b()
    dwarf_get_fde_info_for_cfa_reg3_b()
    uses Dwarf_Small * and also Dwarf_Signed
    arguments changed to Dwarf_Unsigned to accurately
    represent the meaning. Adds a Dwarf_Block
    replacing a pointer/length pair of arguments,

    dwarf_expand_frame_instructions()
    arguments much changed to allow
    access to frame instructions that
    handle *all* frame instructions,
    not just DWARF2

    dwarf_get_frame_instruction()
    dwarf_frame_instr_head_dealloc()
    are new to enable correct printing of
    frame instructions without decoding the
    instruction bits.
    making the argumente clearer.

    commit a7ea4f95c665e11068044bbce0f15765dd535e98

    Now making this up to date with git log.
            modified:   ChangeLog

    At this point the two remaining issues
    coverity scan detects are
      CID 238474 memory leak on an error, and
      it is not clear to me where the leak is.
      coverity reports all the details but..
      the source looks correct.

      CID 206732 coverity determines that a loop
      cannot possibly result in a count of 0,
      though such seems possible.

    One assumes one is just missing something in each
    case.  Continuing to look.

    Small but important incompatibility:

    Dwarf_Error, which was the second argument.
    That argument was not used!

    commit 457d18129ee133a463f083d4be75029677c441ab

    Coverity scan found 18 issues.

    This should fix all of them.
    All but one represented a possible memory leak
    in an error condition.   One is a possible
    duplicate free.
    A few instances here of removing unneeded blank lines
    and fixing too-long lines.

    commit e7cb3d7c880d5ec304646eb29356986b1b7d3447

    A small tool now notices instances of multiple
    blank lines and eliminates all but one of them.
    Also notices something like
             }

        }
    (with the blank line between) and drops that empty pointless blank line.

    commit 58920809a408eeac18afb1ca14fa5ba545120ae7

    A recent update changed things.  make dist
    was now causing test/dummyexecutable to be rebuilt
    from test/dummyexecutable.c.  That was not intended.
    So renamed dummyexecutable.c so make cannot make
    the connection or try to rebuild dummyexecutable.

    This simple change just makes what is going on slightly
    clearer with respect to the two object sections involved.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debuglink.c

    This file should not be in libdwarfp, libdwarfp gets the
    content from libdwarf source.
            deleted:    src/lib/libdwarfp/dwarf_string.c

    Added an exit 0 so even if run the script does nothing. As intended!
    It is really documentation and should not be run.
            modified:   test/buildingdummy.sh
            renamed:    test/dummyexecutable.c -> test/dummysourceignore

    The makefile reflects the name changes so the files get into
    the make dist output.

    No longer defines DW_OBJ_LSB or DW_OBJ_MSB
    or the type Dwarf_Endian.

    No longer defines DW_ENDIAN_BIG DW_ENDIAN_LITTLE
    Use DW_END_big and DW_END_little from dwarf.h.

    Using three different name sets was an accident of history.
    Instead, now using DW_END_big and DW_END_little from dwarf.h
    (These  were introduced in DWARF3.)
    The ranges of endian fit in a Dwarf_Small.

    There is no actual compatibility issue for library
    users as all the uses are in dwarfdump and libdwarf.

    Date:   Mon Sep 6 14:08:54 2021 -0700

        Major incompatible change for a very small
        and unusual use-case.
        Ordinary libdwarf use or just

        Now
        struct Dwarf_Obj_Access_Interface_a_s
        struct Dwarf_Obj_Access_Methods_a_s
        struct Dwarf_Obj_Access_Section_a_s
        have all the fields they should have had all along,
        but the member names have appropriate 2-letter prefixes
        to make it easy to quickly find uses of the members.
        This only affects those applications reading dwarf
        from memory (meaning, there is no file existing to read).
        This is typical for just-in-time (jit) compilers.
                modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h

        Now we have a worked out example demonstrating the
        abilility to use data in memory as DWARF infomation.
                renamed:    jitreader.c -> ../src/bin/dwarfexample/jitreader.c

        The following were modified to match up with the
        new names, as libdwarf actually uses, internally,
        the data in the above-named structs.

    Date:   Mon Sep 6 10:53:19 2021 -0700

        Renamed the test case to provide a better idea
        as to what the test shows: accessing all of libdwarf
        where the DWARF information is not in a file at all,
        or is in a special file format which is
        not Elf or PE or MacOS.

    Author: David Anderson <davea42@linuxmail.org>
    Date:   Sat Sep 4 16:47:02 2021 -0700

        Added filesize to the access function pointer list, making
        it possible to correctly deal with file sizes Where it
        was not previously possible in libdwarf.

        For callers passing a path or reading via an fd all this
        is invisible.

        For people wishing to use dwarf_object_init_b() on DWARF
        which is in memory (possibly something never on disk) or
        in a special file format this change makes it possible to
        have libdwarf work properly and safely.

        struct Dwarf_Obj_Access_Interface_a_s is similar to the
        previous struct name, but the members of the struct are
        ai_object and ai_methods, making it easier to grep for
        the usage.

        struct Dwarf_Obj_Access_Methods_a_s is similar to the old
        struct name but it adds a new method om_get_filesize. And
        all member names prefixed with om_ so the fields can be
        found with grep easily.  And the order of the values in
        the struct changed slightly.

    commit ee98aefb1c51e9dc2b654c783217dad765323e2d

    Now, with --enable-shared the shared library
    uses gcc -visibility=hidden (if your non-Windows compiler
    supports it) to reduce the size of the elf .dynsym
    section.  For libdwarf, this reduces the
    external symbol count from 542 to 373, a 32 percent
    savings in symbols to be read/relocated
    in loading libdwarf.so

    Windows builds already supported Windows
    facilities with the same effect.

    Version 4.7 27 August 2021.
    The example code for dwarf_get_location_op_value_d()
    mixed up the arguments opd<n> vs raw<n>

    anyone find the mistake. Fixed in the document.

    Now the _swap_ small private functions are separated
    from dwarf_util.c and the includes ref the new name.
    Linux shared libs not buildable with -fvisibility
    at this point. But the new
    dwarf_memcpy_swap.c,h help get to a workable sharedbuild.

    commit 80a0f39597bbcf4d978db05a5f52dc11924f49a5

    Add DW_API to explicitly set public symbols

    This allow less collision symbols, detect errors,
    optimisations during link, etc..

    On Windows, here are some numbers :

    Libraries both compiled with -O2

    without DW_API : 584815 bytes
    with DW_API :    578671 bytes

    1.05% gain (size)

    after stripping :

    without DW_API : 453120 bytes 506 symbols
    with DW_API :    446976 bytes 338 symbols

    1.35% gain (size)

    Now does more checking and adds a useful
    comment in the output opscounttab.c where
    we have a DW_OP with two spellings (which are extensions,
    not standard DW_OP instances).
    Reads dwarf.h to be sure the fast-access table

    generated source..
    Now includes config.h.
    data is static not malloc-d.

    This source is not part of dwarfdump. Moved to its
    own directory. Slightly changed so we avoid using dwarf_names.h
    as we get the same data from libdwarf.h
    The program generates a fresh opcountstab.c for dwarfdump.
    Used by 'make rebuild'
            renamed:    src/bin/dwarfdump/buildopscounttab.c -> src/bin/buildopstab/buildopscounttab.c

    Adding in buildopstab as a target directory

    commit 79342e6f7ed03581268d3932ec03b39180cc704e

    The table of nearly 500 error strings is now a simple
    array, eliminating nearly 500 relocations
    from DSO startup. It does take 50K space, whereas
    the real strings are about 24K. But the relocations
    are a time waster.
    Shortened a few default error strings that were
    overly long --- Reducing the string length static dimension
    by about 13 bytes each entry compared to previous.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_errmsg_list.h
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_error.c
    Added new checks to determine the wasted space and

    commit b058e47027763a60705892bf0b88e0ca0c602552

    These fix warnings about unused variables.

    DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_LEN_CK->DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK
    as we don't need to have the length, just the value.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_dsc.c

    Here we avoid the need for a local variable we cannot use.
    Because in some cases we just need to skate
    by an leb number and update the area pointer,
    not needing the value in the leb.
    DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK->SKIP_LEB128_CK

    New macros SKIP_LEB128_LEN_CK and SKIP_LEB128_CK.
    And some macros get a more explicit error value
    via _dwarf_error_string().

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h

    NEW LEB FUNCTION:
    Implement the new dwarf_skip_leb128 function.
    Faster than actually getting the value when
    we don't need the value. Works for signed and
    unsigned leb.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_debug_names.c

    Improved comment

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfgen/dwarfgen.cc

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.c

    Corrected: now has dn_abbrev_table_size
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.h

    Function prototype for dwarf_dnames_sizes() is now correct.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h

    Now has a static setup for creating a real .debug_names

    function (which is only useful for testing).
    Not yet possible to create section data via calls.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_debug_names.c

    Correcting the use  of dwarf_global_formref()
    where the reference can be DW_AT_type and DW_FORM_ref_sig8
    so we understand what section is being targeted by
    an offset. And can check and report the target die TAG
    and name (if it has a DW_AT_name).

    commit 0c5199d6a6ced9fa466d6c7632337ddf3519b1e6

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.c
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_debugnames.h

    Cleaned up spacing in find_cu_die_base_fields()
    Added _dwarf_fill_in_abcom_from_context() and
    _dwarf_fill_in_context_from_abcom so that
    abbreviations reading is no longer directly tied
    to .debug_abbrev but can now also be used for
    the abbreviations table in .debug_names.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c

    More complete handlilng of is_info for DWARF4
     .debug_info/.debug_types.  Now we use DW_FORM_ref_sig8
    to refer to .debug_types from .debug_info properly.
    dwarf_global_formref() and dwarf_global_formref_b()
    exist as the latter is needed for the offset
    in .debug_types needs to have the is_info =FALSE
    to check the reference.
    Other places needed slightly corrected handling
    of is_info.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_form.c

    Now with a new field, pubnames_context->pu_pub_entries_end_ptr,
    to provide a sharper 'end of an entries contribution error
    check' than simply the end of the section.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_global.c
    Added  Dwarf_Byte_Ptr pu_pub_entries_end_ptr;
    for the improved checking.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_global.h

    Now with _dwarf_fill_in_context_from_abcom() and
    _dwarf_fill_in_abcom_from_context() to isolate abbreviation
    reading from any specific section.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_opaque.h

    Using _dwarf_fill_in_context_from_abcom() and
    _dwarf_fill_in_abcom_from_context() to isolate abbreviation
    reading from any specific section.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_query.c

    Now using internal struct Dwarf_Abbrev_Common_s to
    isolate abbreviation reading from any specific section.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_util.c

    Declares a revised struct Dwarf_Abbrev_Common_s.
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_util.h

    dwarf_formref now adds a Dwarf_Bool *is_info argument
    so we can fully treat DWARF4 debug_info/debug_names
    properly.
    This is a change to dwarf_formref() argument list.
    Added dwarf_global_formref_b() to return an is_info
    flag along with the offset (for DWARF4
    section .debug_info or .debug_names that offset applies to)
    Some dwarf_dnames function prototypes changed, but
    those are not yet correct, ignore them.

    This script is no longer needed or wanted.
    autogen.sh updates the libdwarf_version.h
    with the proper version number string instead
    of a date.

    commit 154a84c5d4bf045d845ad10bf08b21954686f43b

    Bringing ChangeLog up to date from git log.
    As a result of this all ChangeLog entries for the project
    wind up in the base 'code' directory ChangeLog.

    commit 93e89df6c68b910780e28113e78535ea3e787eee

    Instead of a date string in src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf_version.h
    we put the current version number extracted from configure.ac
    at autogen.sh time. This means the 'Generated' messages
    reflect what matters: the version number triple.
    When 'make rebuild' is done next all the necessary generated
    code gets regenerated.

    This now modifies src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf_version.h with
    the latest version number (currently 0.1.1) as VERSION_DATE_STRING
            modified:   autogen.sh
            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf_version.h

    Now the generated comments say the Generated source version
    instead of generated date string.

    commit 95edf93c288433a7d13bfe0d35d0481693e968ca

    Revised wording in error handling
    descriptions. When libdwarf is
    unable to report an error
    (the user provided no Dwarf_Error
    argument or errhandler function)
    the library prints a short message
    on stderr starting with the word 'libdwarf'
    and adding the error number it was unable
    to otherwise report.

    commit aa82e89aadefc51a4ec160cfe4045378ca5fd083

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_die.c
    Ensured every error case appropriate does
    dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc() now to free resources
    as soon as possible.

            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/print_frames.c
    Corrected spelling in an error message.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_die_deliv.c
    Added specificity to an error message.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.c
    Removed unused library-internal arguments.
    Added error checks to publicly visible functions
    to prevent user calls with null pointers
    from crashing libdwarf.
    Added magic numbers so the library can recognize
    garbage or stale pointers, and on free ensure
    the magic numbers are zeroed.
    Moved dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc to dwarf_loclists.c
    to be near the other dealloc functions for locations
    lists.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loc.h
    Added magic number fields lc_magic, ld_magic, and
    ll_magic. Defined LOCLISTS_MAGIC.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_loclists.c
    Added additional checks of incoming pointers to avoid
    crashing in case of user errors.
    Set and cleared the magic number fields as
    apprpropriate.
    Corrected the  dealloc/free code so it
    works properly in all cases.

            modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_rnglists.c
    Deleted #if 0 debug printf lines two places.

    commit 1d9d4d16c5af77efbb619d7264873393af25564f

    Now all the arguments to public functions
    (and local ones) are all used appropriately.
    We use 'magic number' RNGLISTS_MAGIC
    so we can detect instances of using
    uninialized or stale rnglists pointers
    (the structs are not them selves visible
    to library callers)

    commit 144a6878c3d88f5db4f59c5f37db4f030ef61acb

    Neither libdwarf nor libdwarfp ever abort() now.

    In case there is no way to report to
    the caller what the error is (because
    the caller provided no means to report error
    messages) libdwarf prints a one-line
    message to stderr with the error number.
    For errors libdwarf and libdwarfp always
    return DW_DLV_ERROR.

    Move dwarf_object_finish() up a few lines to be
    right next to dwarf_object_init_b() as it should
    have been all along.

    commit 91c4bbf0e453db284f5cbea221c860ec53f378cb

    modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/libdwarf.h
    These two are obsolete, their code is already gone
    from libdwarf.  dwarf_get_location_op_value_c() dwarf_highpc()

    dwarf_print_memory_stats()
    is really useless, the
    implementation is...an empty function.

    dwarf_get_abbrev_count()
    was never safe to use.
    And nobody actually needs to know the count of abbrevs
    in the entire .debug_abbrev section.

    modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_abbrev.c
    delete the unsafe function dwarf_get_abbrev_count()

    modified:   src/lib/libdwarf/dwarf_alloc.c

    commit f8826f61ca8ac8f3ba5528c0378eb814df621732

    The dwarf_init*() functions had an 'access'
    argument that has meant nothing.
    For a few hours it was defined as zero.
    (since the DW_DLC defines in libdwarf
    have been removed).
    Now that useless argument has
    been deleted entirely, reducing
    the number of arguments to those functions
    by one.

    Prevent -c (plain -c with no trailing letters)

    Ensure gf_use_old_dwarf_loclist false. That refers
    to obsolete API functions.
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/command_options.c

    Delete the call to print_locs() as it
    was only usable for DWARF2,3, and could
    never be guaranteed to work due to the way
    the standard was written..
            modified:   src/bin/dwarfdump/dwarfdump.c

    Delete dwarf_srclines_dealloc(), obsolete
    modified: doc/libdwarf.mm

    Revise description of --file-line5=<val>
    as we no longer test or use obsolete functions.
    Ensure that --file-line5= only requests
    s2l and singldw5 (dwarfdump enum values)
    so we just call the desired functions.
    modified: src/bin/dwarfdump/command_options.c

    commit 88bf7c78814c5a27392a62dab9ab3ce6a949ea01

    Now the DEBUG_INFO macros have the same value in
    glflags.h and pro_opaque.h. It's not essential,
    but looks better.

    In pro_opaque.h the values matter as they must match
    locations in a C array.
    So we changed the values (and in two cases names)
    in glflags.h to match.
    Each set of defines has a nearby comment mentioning
    the other set.

    commit 8de094bbf4007cff0d355ee7b786c29725a22fe5

    It was using sed and
      grep -o
    to extract the v_maj etc to make the
    complete version number,
    but -o is not a standard option.
    It did nothing on FreeBSD 12.

    Now there is is a python 3 script
    that does the entire job and we test
    the exit code so in case of failure
    it all stops and the python error message (to stderr)
    can be noticed easily.

    commit cf3010079efbd34c6ffb0fe3d4c6aad362a0c585

    Now can build the pdfs.
    The build is ONLY done in a build tree
    and should never be automatic.
    Only build if you've changed a .mm .
    Build by
      cd doc && make buildconsumerpdf
    or
      cd doc && make buildproducerpdf
    The Makefile copies the pdf built to the source tree.
