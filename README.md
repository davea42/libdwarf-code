[![Travis Build

# This is README.md
## BUILDING from a git clone of the source tree with configure
   in source base dir, do
      x=`pwd`
      sh autogen.sh
      rm -rf /tmp/empty
      mkdir /tmp/empty
      cd /tmp/empty
      # CFLAGS and enable-wall and
      # dwarfgen and dwarfexample are optional.
      CFLAGS='-g -O0' $x/configure \
         --enable-dwarfexample --enable-dwarfgen \
         --enable-wall
      make 
      make check


## BUILDING from a git clone of the source tree with cmake
   # where code is the directory name for the libdwarf project
   rm -rf /tmp/bld
   mkdir /tmp/bld
   cd /tmp/bld
   cmake -DDO_TESTING=ON -DBUILD_DWARFEXAMPLE=ON \
      -DBUILD_DWARFGEN=ON  /path/to/code
   ctest -R self

# The following does not necessarily work. ?
To build using CMake one might do
* `cd /a/b/libdwarf-1`
* configure: `cmake . -B_Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
* build: `cmake --build _Release --target dd`
* (optionally install): `sudo cmake --build _Release --target install`

# for autotools builds, see README

### Using autotools
IGNORE THE FOLLOWING. NEEDS REWRITE

#### Building in Source Tree

```bash
cd /a/b/libdwarf-1
./configure
make dd
#You may need to be root to do the following copy commands
cp dwarfdump/dwarfdump      /usr/local/bin
cp dwarfdump/dwarfdump.conf /usr/local/lib
#The following is optional, not needed to run dwarfdump
#when doing the default build.
cp libdwarf/libdwarf.a      /usr/local/lib
```

#### Building Out of Source Tree

```bash
mkdir /var/tmp/dwarfex
cd /var/tmp/dwarfex
/a/b/libdwarf-1/configure
make dd
```
 In this case the source directory is not touched and
all objects and files created are under `/var/tmp/dwarfex`
 
 NOTE: When building out of source tree the source tree
 must be cleaned of any files created by a build
 in the source tree. This is due to the way GNU Make
 VPATH works.
### Build All
 
 To build all the tools (including dwarfgen and 
dwarfexample) use `--target all` on CMake or `make all` on autotools. 
There are known small compile-time issues with building dwarfgen on 
 MaxOSX and most don't need to build dwarfgen.

### Options

By default configure compiles and uses libdwarf.a.
With `-Dshared=ON` (CMake) or `--enable-shared` (autotools)
appended to the configure step, 
both libdwarf.a and libdwarf.so 
 are built. The runtimes built will reference libdwarf.so.

With `-Dnonshared=FALSE` (CMake) or `--disable-nonshared` (autotools)
appeded to the configure step, 
 libdwarf.so is built and used; libdwarf.a is not built.

Sanity checking:
 Recent gcc has some checks that can be done at runtime.
   -fsanitize=undefined
 which are turned on here by --enable-sanitize at build time.

### Distributing

When ready to create a new source distribution do
a build and then 
  make dist
