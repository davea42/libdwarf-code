2019-04-24 David Anderson
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c(_dwarf_next_cu_internal):
        Allow a null as the next_cu_offset pointer 
        passed in.
      * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c: Correct the check
        for a dwarf-related section.  Correct
        the error code returned in several places.
      * dwarf_elfread.c:a Correct the error code
        returned and one return value.
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Add specific errors relating
        to nolibelf elf reading.
      * dwarf_generaic_init.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
      * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_highpc_b): Allow a couple
        of pointer args to be null in case clients
        are uninterested in returning values.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Added DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_ERROR,
        DW_DLE_ELF_STRING_SECTION_ERROR.
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Version 2.72. Documented that
        dwarf_next_cu_header_d() and dwarf_hipc_b()
        allow specific arguments to be null.
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated
2019-04-22 David Anderson
      * dwarf_generic_init.c, dwarf_machoread.c,
        dwarf_object_detector.c,
        dwarf_object_read_common.c,dwarf_peread.c: Add test 
        for _MSC_VER for Windows MSVC.
2019-04-22   David Anderson
      * dwarf_frame.c: Add ifdef/include of stdint.h
        and inttypes.h and add casts using uintptr_t
        so we avoid some compiler warnings.
      * dwarf_groups.c,dwarf_tied.c,
        pro_alloc.c,pro_die.c,pro_init.c: Add ifdef/include
        of stdint.h
        and inttypes.h as the updated dwarf_tsearch.h
        requires uintptr_t.
      * dwarf_loc.c,pro_expr.c: Add ifdef/include of stdint.h
        and inttypes.h  so we can use uintptr_t
        in casts and avoid compiler warnings.
      * dwarf_tsearchhash.c: Add ifdef/include of stdint.h
        and inttypes.h for dwarf_tsearch.h so we can use uintptr_t
        in casts and avoid compiler warnings.
2019-04-21   David Anderson
      * dwarf_pe_descr.h: Added a comment specifying
        a MS web page describing
        how  the section data length and content is 
        calculated and handled.
      * dwarf_peread.c(pe_get_section_info): The understanding
        of the length of section data was overly simplistic.
        Now with all the bytes filled in properly in this function.
2019-04-21   David Anderson
      * dwarf_peread.c: Now getting pe section
        data returns a meaningful section virtual address.
2019-04-19   David Anderson
      * CMakeLists.txt: Add new files to the files to build.
      * Makefile.am: add the new .h and .c files.
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c(reloc_incomplete): Reformat
        the long 'if' to make it easier to read.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: Remove the full list of
        relocations header files as no longer needed,
        include dwarf_elf_defines.h instead.
        Remove the
        is_??bit_abs_reloc() predicate functions. Move
        to  dwarf_elf_rel_detector. (renamed the functions).
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Added 
        DW_DLE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR,
        DW_DLE_INTERNAL_NULL_POINTER,
        DW_DLE_SECTION_STRING_OFFSET_BAD,
        DW_DLE_SECTION_INDEX_BAD, DW_DLE_INTEGER_TOO_SMALL,
        DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_LINK_ERROR,DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_GROUP_ERROR,
        DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_COUNT_MISMATCH,
        DW_DLE_ELF_STRING_SECTION_MISSING,DW_DLE_SEEK_OFF_END,
        DW_DLE_READ_OFF_END for use by the nolibelf
        elf reader.
      * dwarf_generic_init.c: Now separates  
        archive access (using libelf) from non-archive (using
        no libelf).
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Revamp commentary about 
        _dwarf_load_section.
      * dwarf_machoread.c: Renamed mo_byteorder to mo_endian
        for consistency. Added filesize to seek/read
        (RRMOA macro)for better checking of offset/size.
      * dwarf_machoread.h: Renamed mo_byteorder to mo_endian.
      * dwarf_object_detector.c: Added filesize to seek/read
        (_dwarf_object_read_random())
        for better checking of offset/size.
      * dwarf_object_read_common.c: Added additional checks
        of seek/read to ensure offset correctness.
        Seek itself allows seeking past end, which we
        do not want.
      * dwarf_object_read_common.h: Added filesize to
        _dwarf_object_read_random argument list.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: Removed trailing whitespace.
        Added _dwarf_elf_nlsetup() declaration for non-libelf.
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: Added ifdef so calls
        do not get warnings when only non-libelf.
      * dwarf_peread.c: Renamed pe_byteorder to pe_endian
        forconsistency.  Added filesize arg to
        _dwarf_object_read_random calls.
      * dwarf_peread.h: Renamed pe_byteorder to pe_endian
        for consistency.
      * dwarf_reading.h: Now RRMOA macro adds filesize
        argument.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Added error codes DW_DLE_SECTION_SIZE_ERROR,
        DW_DLE_INTERNAL_NULL_POINTER,DW_DLE_SECTION_STRING_OFFSET_BAD,
        DW_DLE_SECTION_INDEX_BAD,DW_DLE_INTEGER_TOO_SMALL,
        DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_LINK_ERROR,DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_GROUP_ERROR,
        DW_DLE_ELF_SECTION_COUNT_MISMATCH,
        DW_DLE_ELF_STRING_SECTION_MISSING,DW_DLE_SEEK_OFF_END,
        DW_DLE_READ_OFF_END          
      * memcpy_swap.h: Returned the function declarations
        to be a single long line each.
      * dwarf_elf_rel_detector.h, dwarf_elf_rel_detector.c:
        Refactored relocation tests determing whether
        the relocation was 32bit or 64bit.
      * dwarf_elf_reloc_386.h,
        dwarf_elf_reloc_aarch64.h,dwarf_elf_reloc_arm.h,
        dwarf_elf_reloc_mips.h,dwarf_elf_reloc_ppc64.h,
        dwarf_elf_reloc_ppc.h,dwarf_elf_reloc_sparc.h,
        dwarf_elf_reloc_x86_64.h: Complete lists
        of relocation types. 
        These are no longer needed by libdwarf, but
        for now remain here.  They were once needed
        for builds lacking a sufficiently complete
        elf.h.
      * dwarf_elfstructs.h: struct declarations for
        the standard Elf structs, but using character
        arrays, not integers. Assures we always have the
        correct lengths independent of integer sizes.
      * dwarf_elf_defines.h:  A basic set of Elf defines
        so the producer code has all it needs.
        Used by the Elf readers (libelf and nolibelf).
      * dwarf_elfread.h: The internally-used set of
        structures that hold nolibelf Elf data.
        The fields are sized to hold 64bit and used for
        both 32bit and 64bit elf. Some extra fields exist
        so aspects that differ by 32/64 are recorded
        by 32/64 specific code so 
      * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c: Actually reads 32 and 64
        Elf and inserts the values into the structures
        declared in dwarf_elfread.h. 
      *	dwarf_elfread.c: This does the nolibelf setup
        and calls dwarf_elf_load_headers.c interfaces
        to help with setup.
2019-03-08   David Anderson
      * pro_section.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2019-03-07   David Anderson
      * pro_section.c(_dwarf_pro_generate_debuginfo): Now when
        there are zero bytes to copy we do not call memcpy,
        as in that case the source pointer will be NULL.
2019-03-06   David Anderson
      * dwarf_form.c,dwarf_global.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
      * pro_init.c: Removed trailing whitespace and fixed indents.
      * pro_forms.c(dwarf_add_AT_any_value_uleb_a): Accidentally
        leftout dbg = ownerdie->di_dbg, resulting in a memory
        leak.
      * pro_frame.c(dwarf_new_fde_a): Accidentally left out
        setting fde_dbg, resulting in a memory leak.
2019-03-04   David Anderson
      * dwarf.h:  Adding go-specifig type attributes
        DW_AT_go_kind,DW_AT_go_key,DW_AT_go_elem,
        DW_AT_go_embedded_field,DW_AT_go_runtime_type.
        Added error code DW_DLE_RETURN_EMPTY_PUBNAMES_ERROR.
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h:
        Added error code DW_DLE_RETURN_EMPTY_PUBNAMES_ERROR.
      * dwarf_global.c: Updates new fields in the hidden struct
        with pubnames(etc) context data and makes it possible
        to see the CU headers there, even if there are no
        actual variables listed for a CU (a fake record
        returned in that case). The change in output
        records (the fake records) only appear if
        the caller has requested such by a call to
        xxxxx
        Implements dwarf_get_globals_header() so a caller
        like dwarfdump can print such section headers.
        Implements dwarf_return_empty_pubnames()
        which just sets a flag so a caller
        like dwarfdump can request such empty sections
        return a useful fake entry.
      * dwarf_global.h: Adds fields like pu_length, pu_version
        so pubnames(etc) sections can have  their cu header
        data returned.
      * dwarf_line.c:  Adds explicit calls to dwarf_dealloc
        in error cases to avoid leaving the allocated memory
        hanging around until dwarf_finish().
      * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h, dwarf_names_enum.h,
        dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated to create the new attributes
        for the Go language.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: Adds  flag de_return_empty_pubnames to
        Dwarf_Debug_s struct so libdwarf can know when fake
        records for CUs with no entries are wanted by
        callers.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Added error code DW_DLE_RETURN_EMPTY_PUBNAMES_ERROR.
        Declares dwarf_return_empty_pubnames() and
        dwarf_get_globals_header() so callers (like dwarfdump)
        can see and access all pubnames(etc)section CU headers.
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Version 2.71. Documents the new functions.
        Revises the contest structure a little so all the pubnames-like
        sections are documented as a related group of functions.
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated. Version 2.71.
      * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.
2019-02-26   David Anderson
      * dwarf.h: Added go language specific attributes.
      * dwarf_line.c(dwarf_srcfiles): Dealloc stmt_list_attr 
        as soon as we lose interest in it instead of waiting
        for dwarf_finish() to be called.
2019-02-24   David Anderson
      * libdwarf_version.h: Updated date string.
      * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h, dwarf_names_enum.h,
        dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with latest date string.
2019-02-18   David Anderson
      * configure.cmake: Now always defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
        so builds work as always.
      *	dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,
        dwarf_original_elf_init.c,
	pro_incl.h,pro_init.c,pro_reloc_stream.c: Now these use
        DWARF_WITH_LIBELF tests to build properly when 
        libelf is to be used.
2019-02-18   David Anderson
      * pro_incl.h: Added comments on tests of HAVE_ELF_H
        and the LIBELF_H macros and the #include of 
        the Elf/libelf headers.
2019-02-18   David Anderson
      * pro_reloc_stream.h: Was testing ifdef HAVE_ELF_H, which
        is unnecessary as it does not use any elf.h types.
2019-02-12   David Anderson
      * dwarf_form.c: Implement dwarf_uncompress_integer_block_a()
        with the proper return type (int). Use this instead
        of the old dwarf_uncompress_integer_block().
      * libdwarf.h.in: Declare dwarf_uncompress_integer_block_a()
        and dwarf_uncompress_integer_block_a().
      * pro_forms.c: Implment the two new functions.
2019-02-10   David Anderson
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h,libdwarf.h.in: Adding
        DW_DLE_NO_STREAM_RELOC_SUPPORT error code.
      * pro_alloc.c,pro_arange.c,pro_die.c,pro_dnames.c,
	pro_error.c,pro_expr.c,pro_finish.c,pro_forms.c,
	pro_frame.c,pro_funcs.c,pro_init.c,pro_line.c,
	pro_macinfo.c,pro_pubnames.c,pro_reloc.c,
	pro_reloc_symbolic.c,pro_section.c,pro_types.c,
	pro_vars.c,pro_weaks.c:
        Removed the ifdef HAVE_ELF_H in most places
        as we can really build everything without elf.h
        except pro_reloc_stream.c (which retains
        the big ifdef HAVE_ELF_H on the whole file).
        Now only a couple files have ifdef HAVE_ELF_H
      * pro_reloc_stream.h: Hiding the function decls
        with ifdef HAVE_ELF_H 
2019-02-10   David Anderson
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h,dwarf_generic_init.c:
        Removed trailing whitespace on one line.
      * dwarf_incl.h: Removed blank line
        and a duplicated include statement.
2019-02-10   David Anderson
      * pro_alloc.c,pro_arange.c,pro_die.c,pro_dnames.c,
        pro_error.c,pro_expr.c,pro_finish.c,pro_forms.c,
        pro_frame.c,pro_funcs.c,pro_incl.h,pro_init.c,
        pro_line.c,pro_macinfo.c,pro_pubnames.c,pro_reloc.c,
        pro_reloc_stream.c,pro_reloc_symbolic.c,pro_section.c,
        pro_types.c,pro_vars.c,pro_weaks.c: Now pro_incl.h
        is almost entirely just #defines and each .c
        brings in just the headers it really wants.
2019-02-10   David Anderson
      * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
	dwarf_names_new.h: Datestring update.
      * libdwarf_version.h: Updated date string
2019-02-07   David Anderson
      * dwarf_elf_access.c, pro_alloc.c, pro_arange,c,pro_die.c,
        pro_dnames.c,pro_error.c,pro_xpr.c,pro_finish.c,
        pro_forms.c,pro_frame.c, pro_funcs.c,pro_init.c,
        pro_line.c,pro_macinfo.c,pro_pubnames.c,pro_reloc.c,
        pro_reloc_stream.c, pro_reloc_symbolic.c,pro_section.c,
        pro_types.c,pro_vars.c,pro_weaks.c:
        Ifdef (entire file after include config.h)
         HAVE_ELF_H so libdwarf compiles without HAVE_ELF_H
      * pro_encode_nm.c: Get rid nested includes, include just
        what is needed.
      * dwarf_generic_init.c: Moved dwarf_set_tied_dbg() here 
        and ifdef HAVE_ELF_H so 
        libdwarf compiles without HAVE_ELF_H
      * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: ifdef HAVE_ELF_H so
        we can emit an error if no Elf: DW_DLE_NO_ELF_SUPPORT.
      * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Add new error DW_DLE_PRODUCER_CODE_NOT_AVAILABLE
        to display if an attempt is made to open an elf object
        when libdwarf built without HAVE_ELF_H. And add
        DW_DLE_NO_ELF_SUPPORT.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Add DW_DLE_PRODUCER_CODE_NOT_AVAILABLE and
        DW_DLE_NO_ELF_SUPPORT.
2019-01-31   David Anderson
      * dwarf_alloc.c, dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_dnames.c, dwarf_dsc.c,
        dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_frame.c,dwarf_frame2.c,
        dwarf_gdbindex.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,dwarf_init_finish.c,
        dwarf_line.c,dwarf_loc.c,dwarf_loc2.h,dwarf_machoread.c,
        dwarf_macro.c,dwarf_macro5.c,dwarf_opaque.h,dwarf_peread.c,
        dwarf_tsearchhash.c,dwarf_util.c,dwarf_xu_index.c,pro_alloc.c,
        pro_arange.c,pro_expr.c,pro_line.c,pro_macinfo.c,
        pro_section.c,pro_types.c: Fixed 56 bugs found
        by llvm's scan-build tool.
2019-01-27   David Anderson
      * dwarf_form.c,dwarf_gdbindex.c,dwarf_object_read_common.c,
        pro_forms.c,pro_section.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
2019-01-27   David Anderson
      * dwarf_object_read_common.c,dwarf_object_read_common.h:
        Now uses the ISO (1990) datatypes off_t and size_t and
        ssize_t for lseek, read.
2019-01-20   David Anderson
      * dwarf_base_types.h: Remove Dwarf_ufixed and 
        Dwarf_sfixed and all __int32_t and __uint32_t use.
        __uint64_t Dwarf_ufixed64 and __int64_t Dwarf_sfixed64
        have also been removed.
      * dwarf_elf_access.c: Remove use of those types here too.
      * dwarf_form.c: Remove references to those types here
        too.
      * dwarf_gdbindex.c, dwarf_gdbindex.h: Replace 
        gdbindex_offset_type headerval[6]
        by char gfs[4][6] (replacing dependence on the  int32
        sorts of types.
      * dwarf_macho_loader.h: Clarified that the uint32_t sorts
        of things are just comments.
      * libdwarf.h.in: Fixed a too-long comment line.
      * libdwarfdefs.h: Removed all the *UINT32* and
        *uint64* use.
      * pro_forms.c,pro_opaque, pro_section.c: 
        Removed all the Dwarf_sfixed and ufixed
        stuff here too.
2019-01-14   David Anderson
     * dwarf_frame.c: Add support for DW_CFA_MIPS_advance_loc8
       (though pointless, really) so we can test all the code
       paths of advance_loc production. 
     * dwarf_frame2.c: Minor formatting cleanup.
     * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Now tests for
       negative line numbers in the table and returns an error
       with the new error code DW_DLE_LINE_TABLE_LINENO_ERROR
       (which indicates a corrupted line table).
     * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names.h, dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated. Just an update of
       the sourcedate comment.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Delete a trailing whitespace character.
     * libdwarf.h.in: Add error DW_DLE_LINE_TABLE_LINENO_ERROR.
     * pro_expr.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     * pro_frame.c( dwarf_add_fde_inst_a): A new simpler 
       more portable implementation of the DW_CFA_advance_loc
       code.
     * pro_opaque.h: Delete blank last line.
2019-01-12   David Anderson
     * dwarf_abbrev.c,dwarf_abbrev.h,dwarf_base_types.h,
       dwarf_die_deliv.c, dwarf_dsc.c,dwarf_error.c,
       dwarf_error.h,dwarf_form.c,dwarf_frame.c,
       dwarf_frame.h,dwarf_frame2.c,dwarf_global.h,
       dwarf_leb.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_line.h,
       dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h,dwarf_loc.c,

       pro_opaque.h,pro_reloc_stream.c,pro_section.c,
       pro_types.c: Removed all instances of use of
       Dwarf_Word, Dwarf_Sword, __int32_t (and other such).
       In nearly all cases the use was gratuitous. In a few
       cases some very old code was problematic (dwarf_frame2.c)
       and is fixed.
2019-01-10   David Anderson
     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.
2019-01-09   David Anderson
     * dwarf_original_elf_init.c: One of the calls to
       dwarf_object_init_b() was checking the result code
       then doing a statment that will crash the caller unless
       the result code was DW_DLV_OK.
2019-01-05   David Anderson
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_generic_init.c: After closing de_fd,
       set de_owns_fd FALSE as an extra guard.
2019-01-04   David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Ensure the configure
       can set O_BINARY if necessary so open() will use it.

     * dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_generic_init.c,dwarf_machoread.c,
       dwarf_opaque.h,dwarf_peread.c: Simplified and unified
       the requirement that dwarf_finish() close the fd
       that dwarf_init_path() opened.

     * configure.ac: Version 20190104
     * dwarf_elf_access.c: Now records that libdwarf owns
       its fd in the elf case and arranges to close it
       when the Dwarf_Debug is being closed.
       This is the case of dwarf_init_path().
       Hopefully will address Coverity CID 190599.
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Now that struct stat
       is not in use delete the sys/types.h and sys/stat.h
       includes as they are no longer needed.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path): When libdwarf 
       owns the fd, call _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd()
       to record that information.
       In the default case (not a known object type)
       we also now close the fd.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Add prototype for 
       _dwarf_elf_record_owned_fd, a new internal function
       so the fd can be closed by libdwarf only when 
       libdwarf owns it.
     * libdwarf_version.h: New date string.

     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Had a pointless call to stat()
       which was noticed by Coverity CID  190601
       as a possible race condition. Deleted the call.
     * dwarf_generic_init(dwarf_init_path):
       Serious bugs introduced yesterday.
       Coverity CID 190600.
       the fd is remembered in the Dwarf_Debug
       being created and will eventually be closed
       when the Dwarf_Debug is closed.
2019-01-02   David Anderson
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c(dwarf_get_real_section_name): 
       Uninitialized local char array
       could lead to unpredictable behavior, so now initialized
       with a NUL first byte so the array is a legal string.
       Coverity CID CID 190598.
     * ChangeLog: Renamed ChangeLog2018. New ChangeLog created.
     * Makefile.am: Added ChangeLog2018 to files in dist.
     * gennames.c(GenerateOneSet): Fixing Coverity CID 190603
       by removing an unused (unusable) value. 
     * dwarf_machoread.c.The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
     * dwarf_peread.c: The include order
       is now libdwarfdefs.h then dwarf_base_types.h
       Was leaking memory re-malloc into local var
       localdoas. Coverity CID 190602.
     * dwarf_generic_init.c(dwarf_init_path): 
       We clarify the use of fd and in case
       of failure ensure we close the fd if
       it is open (fd >= 0). 
     * dwarf_object_detector.c(dwarf_object_detector_path):
       Mistaken 'fix'
     * libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.
