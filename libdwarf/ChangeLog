2020-08-22: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
	  dwarf_names_new.h,libdwarf_version.h: Updated  version
      string, regenerated files that reference it.
2020-08-21: David Anderson
    * dwarf_init_finish.c(insert_sht_list_in_group_map):
      Added checks of dss_data_was_malloc around
      a couple of calls saying free(secdata.dss_data).
      The missing checks could only result in duplicate
      free with user calls that allocated their
      own section data to load a section and a certain
      error arising during the call.
    * dwarf_loc.c: To elminate ambiguity, renamed
      some fields from lowpc to rawlowpc (for example).
    * dwarf_loclists.c(build_array_of_lle): Removed
      a block of code duplicating work done in dwarf_loc.c.
      Fixed arguments passing ld_lopc, ld_highpc
      to pass ld_rawlow, ld_rawhigh for correctness.
2020-08-21: David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.07. Corrected quote mismatches
      in the mm commands, and a couple of stray
      characters after a .P command
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.07. Regenerated.
2020-08-18: David Anderson
    * checkexamples.c: Corrected example_rnglist_for_attribute()
      example.
    * dwarf_ranges.c: Corrected a comment and removed #if 0
      code as it is obsolete.
    * dwarf_rnglists.c(dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields_a):
      Allow the pointer-arguments used to return data to
      the caller to be null pointers safely, as libdwarf2.1.pdf
      suggested that was legal.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Version 3.06. Corrected the example
      calling dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields_a().
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, Version 3.06
     
      
2020-08-10: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
	  dwarf_names_new.h,libdwarf_version.h: Updated  version
      string, regenerated files that reference it.
2020-08-10: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_defines.h,dwarf_elfread.c: A linux kernel used a
      R_X86_64_NONE (which means ignore the relocation) and
      now we deal with it properly for EM_X86_64.
2020-08-02: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Added a constructor for Dwarf_Locdesc_c
      (DW_DLA_LOCDESC_C) so fields ld_lle_value and
      ld_kind get non-zero and 
      erroneous initial values so
      the values can be checked later for correctness.
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Added error DW_DLE_LOCATION_ERROR.
    * dwarf_loc.c: Now we rigorously set and check the fields
      ld_lle_value and ld_kind. 
      _dwarf_locdesc_c_constructor() sets those two fields
      so we can check correctness and in case of error, 
      report the details.
    * dwarf_loc.h: Added constructor prototype and a special
      DW_LLE_VALUE_BOGUS initial value (invisible to 
      library callers).
    * dwarf_loclists.c: After malloc use the  Dwarf_Locdesc_c
      constructor so later error checking possible.
    * libdwarf.h.in: Added error DW_DLE_LOCATION_ERROR.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 3.05. Additional detail on
      return values for dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d()
      and documented dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_c() 
      (recommending use of dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d()
      instead)
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 3.05. Regenerated.
2020-07-28: David Anderson
    * dwarf_locationop_read.c: Added DW_OP_GNU_variable_value.
    * dwarf_names.c, dwarf_names_enum.h: Regenerated.
    * dwarf.h: Added in GNU names that had been accidentally
      ommitted: DW_AT_GNU_deleted,DW_AT_GNU_locviews,
      DW_AT_GNU_entry_view,DW_OP_GNU_variable_value.
      These caused the regeneration of dwarf_names.h.
2020-07-22: David Anderson

      Updated copyright date. Reformatted copyright to
      have slightly shorter lines, no change in content.
2020-07-22: David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Now Rev 3.04. Revised the 
      Error Handling section for greater clarity.
      Revised dwarf_init_path() to correct formatting
      errors. 
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated as rev 3.04 .
    * dwarf_generic_init.c(dwarf_init_pathh): Removed
      the error-handling so when the call fails the
      Dwarf_Debug argument is not touched. 
      For the PE case return  the DW_DLV_ERROR or
      DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY (return left off by accident).
    * dwarf_arange.c: Reformatted the copyright
      to have shorter lines.
2020-07-17: David Anderson

      whitespace.  Fix indents.
2020-07-15: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Improved printf if DEBUG
      is turned on, with #undef DEBUG in source so
      necessary to modify the source and rebuild
      to get the voluminous alloc/dealloc debugging
      printf turned on.
2020-07-14: David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Version 3.02. Documents the new call
      dwarf_get_debug_sup() to access the DWARF5
      .debug_sup section.
    * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Version 1.51.  Documents the new

      of value of
      DW_GNUIVIS_static (a new non-standard name in dwarf.h)
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in,libdwarf.h.in: With the
      two new errors and declaration of
      dwarf_add_debug_sup() to produce .debug_sup
      and dwarf_get_debug_sup() to retrieve the section values..

    * dwarf_opaque.h: Added 2lines of comment
      about cc_debug_offset.
    * dwarf_query.c(_dwarf_get_ranges_base_attr_value):
      Simplified as the cu_context
      has the base values, no need to read
      DIEs/Attributes here.
2020-07-09: David Anderson
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Changing a comment about libdwarf
      and the tied file (if any).
2020-07-08: David Anderson

      in near future correctness of offsets in 
      .debug_gnu_pubnames/pubtypes can be checked.

      dwarf_get_loclist_entry().
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: regenerated.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Deprecates dwarf_get_loclist_entry().
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, version 2.99.
    * dwarf_locationop_read.c: Pass real address-size to
      read_encoded_addr() so it will work properly.
2020-06-29: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c: Added sanity checks
      on section size of the section strings and
      the symbol strings.
      All the section-size errors now use

      dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated.
2020-06-29: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elfread.c: Added checks on section sizes
      and offsets to ensure they don't exceed file size
      (but only check when we try to read them, we
      want to read dwarf even if sections we do not
      care about have damaged section headers).
    * dwarf_peread.c: Fixed indentation mistake.
2020-06-28: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_defines.h: Adding R_386_GOTPC
      so we don't rely on /usr/include to have the
      ones we need.
    * dwarf_elf_rel_detector.c: Adding R_386_GOTPC
      to identify the relocation as 32bit.
2020-06-27: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c(_dwarf_free_all_of_one_debug): If space 
      for debug_rnglists or
      debug_loclists was malloc'd (relocations
      or compressed sections force malloc) we
      now call the function that frees that
      data.  That function renamed:
      rela_free->malloc_section_free.
2020-06-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_loc.c: Corrected indents.

      trailing whitespace.
    * dwarf_peread.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
    * dwarf_rnglists.c: Removed trailing whitespace.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Rev 2.98. Added documentation
      on the .debug_names section printing functions.
      These intended for debugging .debug_names
      (that is, by dwarfdump),
      not things user code are likely to want to use. 
      Documented the new function 
      dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields_a() as the original
      dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields() 
      (which is still there and works as well as before)
      left off a field important to callers.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Rev 2.98. Regenerated.
2020-06-22: David Anderson
    * dwarf_loc.c: Using knowledge of the base address status
      improve messaging while reducing execution time.
    * dwarf_loclists.c: Properly deal with setting
      up for output in case .debug_addr missing (fixing
      an omission).
    * dwarf_peread.c: In load_optional_header64() we were
      failing to read hdr.ImageBase which caused addresses
      to be wrong (base address needed to be set).
    * dwarf_rnglists.c: Based on knowledge of lack/presence
      of .debug_addr improve messaging and reduce
      cpu-time spent.
    * dwarf_rnglists.h: Added 2 line commentary.
    * libdwarf.h.in,generated_libdwarf.h.in: Added
      dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields_a(), the original
      function was inadequate.
2020-06-19: David Anderson
    * dwarf_reloc_x86_64.hr,dwarf_reloc_x86_64.h: Added in
      R_X86_64_PC64 relocation as llvm is using it.
2020-06-17: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c: Catch a potential division by 
      zero error. 
    * dwarf_peread.c: Added comments.
2020-06-17: David Anderson
    * dwarf_loclists.c, dwarf_rnglists.c: Rename 
      length_size->offset_size
      for clarity and correct the computation of the
      length of the offsets array.
2020-06-17: David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Pick up CU DIE base fields
      always. Not just for DWARF4,5.
    * dwarf_loc.c: Clarify the flow. A comment added.
    * dwarf_form.c: Added missing DW_FORM_loclistx from
      a switch.
2020-06-16: David Anderson
    * dwarf_query.c, dwarf_util.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
      Changed indents and line lengths in a small area to match
      the usual look.
2020-06-16: Jorge Gorbe Moya 
    * dwarf_query.c, dwarf_util.c: Correct the handling
      of DW_UT initializations.
2020-06-16: David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_frame2.c,dwarf_loc.c:
      Remove trailing whitespace.
2020-06-14: David Anderson
    * libdwarf1.1.mm: Added examples to the Error Handling
      section as the previous version was pretty vague
      about the best way to call libdwarf to deal
      with errors.
    * libdwarf1.1.pdf: Generated version 2.97.
     
2020-06-14: David Anderson

      warnings from certain compiler/pointer-size
      environments.
    * dwarf_loc.c: Update the loclist head
      structure  ll_bytes_total
      field with DWARF 2,3,4 loclists too.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Add cc_highest_known_code
      to Dwarf_CU_Context_s for better
      error reporting and align some field names
      for a better appearance.
    * dwarf_query.c: Improved error reporting
      when an abbrev code missing.
    * dwarf_util.c: Keep track of highest abbrev
      code seen (per compilation unit).
    * dwarf_util.h: Internal function declaration
      changed to allow reporting of highest
      abbrev code.
2020-06-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
      dwarf_names_new.h,libdwarf_version.h: updated
      version string.
2020-06-12: David Anderson
    * checkexamples.c,dwarf_alloc.c,dwarf_arange.c,
      dwarf_frame.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h,
      dwarf_loc.c,dwarf_loc.h,dwarf_locationop_read.c,
      dwarf_loclists.c,dwarf_query.c,dwarf_rnglists.c,
      dwarf_util.c,libdwarf.h.in: Fixed indents
      and removed trailing whitespace.
2020-06-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Added free of loclists to 
      _dwarf_free_all_of_one_debug().
    * dwarf_loc.c: Created _dwarf_free_op_chain()
      and call it so even in case of error nothing leaks.
      Some adjustments to indents.
    * dwarf_loclists.c: _dwarf_dealloc_loclists ->
      _dwarf_dealloc_loclists_context for clarity.
      Modified _dwarf_free_loclists_head() to get
      leak-free behavior.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Reflects above name change.
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Corrected and amplified
      words on the new functions.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2020-06-10: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
      dwarf_names_new.h,libdwarf/libdwarf_version.h:
      updated version string.

      Added dwarf_locationop_read.c, dwarf_loclists.c.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Corrected a comment about reserved numbers.
      Reflects name change from struct Dwarf_Loc_c_s to
      struct Dwarf_Loc_Expr_Op_s. 
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Added DW_DLE_LOCLISTS_ERROR.
    * dwarf_form.c: Added arguments to the library
      internal function _dwarf_formblock_internal()
      for better support of DWARF5 loclist creation.
    * dwarf_frame2.c: Changed a local from unsigned
      to Dwarf_Unsigned as well as changing pointer
      casts from 'unsigned long' to Dwarf_Unsigned.
    * dwarf_loc.c: Lots of refactoring to make
      the flow easier to understand.
      Moved _dwarf_read_loc_expr_op() to
      a new file dwarf_locationop_read.c as the 
      function is quite large.
      Renamed other functions so the names are not
      so much alike.
    * dwarf_loc.h: New fields in Dwarf_Loc_Chain_s
      to support the raw vs. cooked values of location

      for internal debug_loclists data.
    * dwarf_rnglists.c: Changed certain arguments
      to Dwarf_Half (address_size etc) where that
      makes sense.  
    * dwarf_util.c: Now dwarf_load_debug_info()
      loads the base data from .debug_rnglists
      and .debug_loclists (DWARF5)
    * libdwarf.h.in: 'unsigned' now 'unsigned int'
      existing function unchanged: dwarf_get_loclist_c()
      new function dwarf_get_locdesc_entry_d()
      new function dwarf_get_loclist_head_basics()
      new function dwarf_get_location_op_value_d()

    * dwarf_form.c: Using DWARFSTRING_ALLOC_SIZE for the
      initial allocation, (mostly) avoiding the need
      for malloc here.  dwarfstring is mainly used
      for error messages, so preallocation is rarely useful
    * dwarf_line.c(create_fullest_file_path): Corrected
      the comments for this function.
2020-05-22: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: New functions with proper type checking:

      to dealloc properly.  Which simplifies the 
      dealloc_globals_chain() call.

      to dealloc properly.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Now uses wrappers
      for the READ_UNALIGNED_CK DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK etc
      macros so the code
      now deallocs appropriately in case of error.
      Most places were not doing full dealloc. Now
      all are.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: New field ar_dbg so attribute
      dealloc is easier.  New chain field ch_itemtype
      so dealloc is simpler and safer.

      as well as documentation of
      dwarf_dealloc_error(),dwarf_dealloc_die(),
      dwarf_dealloc_attribute().

    * libdwarf.h.in: Revised a couple rnglists functions
      by removing unneeded arguments and revising the arguments

      dwarf_get_rnglist_head_basics(), and
      dwarf_get_rnglists_entry_fields()
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated.
    * dwarf_rnglists.c: Checked a pointer argument for null before using.

      dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed(theform) created, now using
      it here and in dwarfdump as needed..
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Corrected indents.
    * dwarf_opaque.h:  Small commentary changes, added the 
      CU Context field cc_dwo_name_present (used for 
      non-standard DWARF4).
    * dwarf_query.c: Simplified some pointlessly messy code.
      Now also using dwarf_addr_form_is_indexed() instead of
      a list missing some DWARF5 values.
    * dwarf_ranges.c: #if 0 some useless code for now. 
    * dwarf_rnglists.c: The .debug_rnglists code is here.
    * dwarf_rnglists.h: For use inside libdwarf. Opaque
      to libdwarf callers.

    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Added a note to Changes that
      instances of 'length_size' in the code and headers
      variable naming will, over time, be changed to 
      'offset_size' as this name suggests what they really

      so we don't stop the loop too early, yet
      still avoid leaking a useless.
2020-04-10: David Anderson
    * debug-cu-tu-indexes-layout.odg: The Split-Dwarf
      (aka debugfission) table layout is simple, but
      this is an introduction to the 
      layout of the arrays.  LibreOffice Draw document.
    * dwarf_init_finish.c: Small enhancements of error messages.
    * dwarf_util.c: Reformatted a macro here
      (READ_UNALIGNED_CK) so the lines are not so long
      and the backslashes are easily seen as complete.
    * dwarf_xu_index.c: There was some confusion in the
      code which prevented it from working.
      Interfaces remain the same, but things work now.
      The first part is a 20 line (or so) explanation
      of some of the internal handling of the tables.
      Now things work. Many error messges get
      detailed information.
    * dwarf_xu_index.h: Added new fields and relabeled
      the N U S fields in the header to match the
      DWARF5 standard.

      specific about each case.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Added a declaration of
      _dwarf_create_address_size_dwarf_error().

      do printf instead.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_frame2.c: Altered the 
      DW_DLE_ADDRESS_SIZE_ERROR
      strings so the 3 cases can be distinquished easily
      (just a convenience for debugging).
    * dwarf_globals.c: Removed one superfluous ().
    * dwarf_query.c: Reforatted lgpl text for shorter
      lines (no change in the content).

    * dwarf_abbrev.c: Generates a more useful and specific
      message in case a TAG is corrupt.
    * dwarf_line.c: After dealloc assign 0 to the pointer.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Improved insert_into_context_list()
      for clarity and correctness. 
    * dwarf_error.c: Removed a couple "!= NULL" in if
      conditions.
    * dwarf_query.c: Uses local variable now to
      satisfy the usual libdwarf convention that in case
      of DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY or DW_DLV_ERROR only the
      Dwarf_Error argument is altered, not other
      pointer args.
    * dwarf_util.h: Declaration for _dwarf_format_TAG_err_msg()
    * dwarf_util.c: Generates a more useful and specific
      message in in _dwarf_format_TAG_err_msg()
      in case a TAG is corrupt.
2020-03-18: David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Rewrote the function that
      keeps the cu_context list in the proper order.
      For clarity and correctness.
2020-03-16: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: A recent change had the wrong
      test during initial Dwarf_Debug
      struct setup meaning dwarf_finish() was not cleaning
      up allocations. This made the runtimes better
      than they should be. Important correction here.
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Drop use of the dwarf_dieoff()
      context list, that was never appropriate. Now
      again with one list.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Removed a list of Dwarf_CU_Contexts,
      that was never correct to have dwarf_offdie maintain
      a list separate from iterating through CUs.
    * dwarf_query.c (dwarf_attrlist): Add a 
      dwarf_dealloc on abbrev_list
      in an error case.
    * dwarf_util.c: Make the lines look a tiny bit
      better avoiding too-long lines.
2020-03-15: David Anderson
    * dwarf_frame2.c: On an internal error (bad dwarf)

      in final form. Respecting dwarf_set_de_alloc_flag().
2020-03-14: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Now adds an optional DEBUG
      macro that libdwarf developers may find useful.
      Revised the dwarf_dealloc code to not require de_alloc_tree.
    * dwarf_line.c: Now dwarf_srcfiles() and dwarf_filename()
      always allocate DW_DLA_STRINGS. Whereas earlier some
      of the strings were actually in a .debug section,
      not allocated. 
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Now dwarf_diename()  and
      dwarf_die_text are documented
      as returning static strings that are not be be
      freed or dwarf_dealloc'd.  This was always true
      but the documentation said dwarf_dealloc() was
      required. Don't use dwarf_dealloc on these returned
      strings.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated, version 2.88
    * dwarf_loc.c: Was incorrectly passing NULL instead
      of dbg to _dwarf_get_alloc in a few places.
    * dwarf_util.c, dwarf_global.c: Now checks more for
      incomplete setup
      of an internal structure to avoid calling dwarf_dealloc
      with NULL as the space to be freed.
2020-03-13: David Anderson
    * dwarf_abbrev.c: Remove erroneous dwarf_dealloc
      introduced yesterday. Caused a coredump
      in FreeBSD 64bit dwarfdump testing.
    * dwarfstring.c: Introduced an extra zero initializer in
      the dwarfstring_destructor() as safe and harmless.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_abbrev.c: Use a wrapper on macro
      DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK
      so we can dwarf_dealloc in case of a problem.
      And be more thorough in various places
      for those dwarf_dealloc.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_die_deliv.c:  A local function now explicitly
      static (_dwarf_siblingof_internal). 
      Following dwarf_dealloc of cudie  we assign 0 to it.`
      New function local_dealloc_cu_context() enables
      accurate and full dealloc of a cu context
      (which means there was some error fount) in
      an easy and complete way.
      local_attrlist_dealloc() does similarly for attrlists.
      A DECODE_LEB128_UWORD_CK now in a wrapper so on error
      we can dwarf_dealloc a DIE.
    * dwarf_macro5.c: Now dwarf_dealloc_macro_context() is safe
      if called with a null argument (and in that case there
      is nothing to do).
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Removed _dwarf_siblingof_internal()
      from the declared functions.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.h, dwarf_opaque.h: Removed trailing whitespace.
      Shortened the lines of the LGPL text (the text
      is unchanged).
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_str_offsets.c,dwarf_util.c: Removed trailing whitespace
      and fixed indent mistakes.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_query.c: Adds wrapper code around some
      dwarf_util.h macros
      so in case of a serious DWARF error we can
      free locally allocated things.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Corrected DW_DLE_STR_OFFSETS_EXTRA_BYTES
      text. The error messages have more detail due to 
      the dwarf_str_offsets.c changes below, so fixed
      the string here.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_macro5.c: Do proper dwarf_dealloc, avoiding
      a pointless dependency on de_alloc_tree freeing 
      things.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Minor cleanup that assigns
      zero after dwarf_dealloc so dead pointers
      not left around.
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_str_offsets.c: Improve messages in case of
      a serious DWARF error, reporting what is wrong
      more precisely and allowing a few bytes of all-zero-bits
      to be allowed at end of section (no error needed).
2020-03-12: David Anderson
    * dwarf_util.c: Revise too-long lines and checks for NULL
      pointers for moderm readability.
      Improve _dwarf_free_abbrev_hash_table_contents() so
      it can safely free an incompletely set up hash table.
2020-03-09: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c: Implements optional (at run time)
      reduced use of the de_alloc_tree search tree
      as a performance enhancement (see libdwarf2.1.mm/pdf).
    * dwarf_alloc.h: Declares _dwarf_alloc_tree_counts(),
      a new hidden function.
    * libdwarf_version.h: New date string
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
      dwarf_names_new.h: New date string so regenerated
      these.
    * libdwarf.h.in: New function dwarf_set_de_alloc_flag()
      declared.
    * generated_libdwarf.h.in: Regenerated
2020-03-02: David Anderson
    * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed one-line #if 0
      code that serves no purpose.
2020-02-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed space character just before newline
      as it  has no useful prupose. 3 places.
2020-02-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h, dwarf_names_enum.h,
      dwarf_names_new.h:
      libdwarf_version.h: updated version string.
2020-02-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Now with dwarfstring
      containers in local scopes and easily evaluated
      as to lifetime and correctness.
2020-02-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elfread.c: Deleted a #if 0 ...#endif few lines.
    * dwarf_line.c: Fixed trailing whitespace.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Removed all use of the
      old dwarf_printf varargs code.  Instead using dwarfstring
      and dwarfstring_append_printf_i() etc.
      And a far simpler _dwarf_printf().
      No longer any sprintf/snprintf/vsnprintf here.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Remove trailing whitespace.
    * dwarf_print_lines.c: Removed all use of the
      old dwarf_printf varargs code.
      No longer any sprintf/snprintf/vsnprintf here.
    * dwarf_util.c: Delete unused buffersetsize function.
      Delete now-unuised dwarf_printf()
    * dwarfstring.c: Now using TRUE FALSE, not DW_DLV anything.
      No one will be testing the integer return value anyway.
      Fixed the code where %-4s was truncating if the string
      to be processed was longer than 4 characters.
    * dwarfstring.h: Added commentary.
    * test_dwarfstring.c: New testcase for dwarfstring
2020-02-21: David Anderson
    * dwarf_arange.c,dwarf_debuglink.c,dwarf_frame2.c:
      removed the last sprintf/snprintf, changed to 
      use dwarfstring.h functions.
2020-02-18: David Anderson
    * dwarf_line.c: Added free() calls to delete_line_context_itself
      to avoid a leak that was created in last commit..
    * dwarf_line.h: Deleted a now-spurious comment.
    * dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Removed an == NULL
      comparison in favor of a !filename_entry_pairs.
2020-02-16: David Anderson
    * libdwarf2.1.mm: Now explains how dwarf_srcfiles()
      name arrays differ in DWARF5 from earlier
      debug_info versions. So callers can use
      the srcfiles array properly.
    * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Now version 2.87, dated 16 February 2020.
    * dwarf_line.c, dwarf_line.h,dwarf_print_lines.c,
      dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h: Recording DW5 line table
      header data more fully so lines print verbose
      prints more of the actual line table header.
2020-02-15: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_init_finish.c: With libelf
      in use there was a mistake that broke dumping some objects that
      needed relocations.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Corrected a is_rela to r_is_rela
2020-02-13: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elfread.c,dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Removed
      trailing whitespace.
2020-02-13: David Anderson
    *  libdwarf_version.h: New version string 
    *  dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
       dwarf_names_new.h: Regenerated with new
       version string.
2020-02-13: David Anderson
     * libdwarf/libdwarf.h.in: Added a new error code to
       properly distinguish between distinct elf section
       header issues related to relocations versus
       other section header issues.
     * libdwarf/generated_libdwarf.h.in: regenerated

    * dwarf_elf_access.c: Adding local READ_UNALIGNED_SAFE
      so we can do libelf relocations properly; .rel and .rela.
    * dwarf_elf_defines.h: Adding R_386_PC32 to the 
      applicable relocation sets.
    * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c: Now we deal with .rel.
      and .rela. relocations for better completeness.
      Removed some code duplication and complexity
      too.
    * dwarf_elf_rel_detector.c: Deals with R_386_PC32 now.
    * dwarf_elfread.c: Add READ_UNALIGNED_SAFE so we can
      do no-libelf relocations properly; .rel and .rela
    * dwarf_elfread.h: Added gr_is_rela field and
      two enums RelocRela and RelocOffsetSize so we have
      type-safety in the argument lists.
    * dwarf_init_finish.c: A new function ensures we
      skip various sections we know we do not want to
      look at.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Declare _dwarf_ignorethissection()
      so libelf and non-libelf can ignore the unwanted
      sections.
    *  dwarf_errmsg_list.h: Entry added for the new
       DW_DLE error code.
2020-02-11: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_access.c,dwarf_line_table_reader_common.h,
      dwarf_tied_decls.h:
      removed trailing whitespace and final blank line.
2020-02-11: David Anderson
    * dwarf_init_finish.c: Removed code that was #if 0 #endif
2020-02-10: David Anderson
    * dwarf_elf_access.c: Now allows for .rel and .rela.
    * dwarf_elf_defines.h: Now allows for .rel and .rela.
    * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now allows for .rel and .rela.
    * dwarf_opaque.h: Adding dss_is_rela so we can
      process .rel. sections too.
2020-01-25: David Anderson
    * dwarf_form.c: DW_FORM_rnglistx was ommitted from a switch statement.
      Adding it in fixed the resulting errors in a DWARF5 object file
      built by clang 9.0.0.0
2020-01-16: David Anderson
    * dwarf_alloc.c,dwarf_die_deliv.c,dwarf_form.a,
      dwarf_query.c,dwarfstring.c,
      pro_reloc.c,pro_reloc_stream.c,pro_reloc_symbolic.c,
      pro_section.c,pro_types.c,pro_vars.c,pro_weaks.c,
      test_dwarfstring.c: Fixed indentations and
      removed trailing whitespace.
    * dwarf_xu_index.c: Ensure local Dwarf_Sig8 variables
      are always initialized. Does not fix any bug but
      does make it easier to read the code.
      Fixes indentation and removes trailing whitespace too.
2020-01-14: David Anderson
    * dwarf_names.c,dwarf_names.h,dwarf_names_enum.h,
      dwarf_names_new.h,libdwarf_version.h: Updated version string.
2020-01-05: David Anderson
    * dwarf_query.c(dwarf_offset_list): Coverity Scan CID 206598.
      Now checks for DW_DLV_ERROR where it failed to do so before,
      and returns an error instead of letting it slip through.
2020-01-03: David Anderson
    * dwarf_load_elf_headers.c(dwarf_elf_load_rela_32):
      Coverity Scan uncovered a memory leak in one
      case. CID 206524
