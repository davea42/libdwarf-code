     * run-all-tests.sh,buildandreleasetest.sh: Now handle
       --enable-nonstandardprintf
       though that's not sufficient to let these work everywhere.
2019-11-04 David Anderson
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Now handles --disable-libelf
       so we can run this test successfully in more environments.
       A few fixes to silly indentations.
       If cmake is not available skip the cmake test.
     * run-all-tests.sh: Now handles --disable-libelf
       and --enable-nonstandardprintf
       and when libelf missing avoids checks that could
       not possibly pass.
2019-10-29 David Anderson
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: If cmake is not installed
       do not attempt to run it.
2019-10-28 David Anderson
     * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: No longer does echo on every file name,
       that was silly.  Answers the  'are we in the right place?' now.
2019-10-24 David Anderson
     * run-all-tests.sh: Improving the precision of
       (meaning adding words to) the
       status messages so it's easier to interpret
       the output text.
2019-10-23 David Anderson
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Do --enable-wall or cmake
       equivalent for every build.
2019-10-22 David Anderson
     * baseconfig.h: Now has a fake PACKAGE_VERSION
       and defines BUILD_STANDARD_SOURCE, both for use
       by buildstandardsource.sh
     * ddbuild.sh: One comment line was long for no
       good reason. Made it into two lines.
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: now the cmake is with -DWALL
2019-10-18 David Anderson
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Reference $HOME, not
       a hard coded home dir.
2019-10-18 David Anderson
     * run-all-tests.sh: using a small function to check for failure
       reduces the file size by more than 40 lines and improves
       readability.
2019-10-17 David Anderson
     * buildandreleasetest.sh:  The cmake test had misspellings
       in the cmake command options.
     * run-all-tests.sh: Renamed from run-bld-tests-readelfobj.sh
       and with small corrections. It now works in one environment!
2019-10-16 David Anderson
     * run-bld-tests-readelfobj.sh: New runs all the make check
       and the overall tests.
     * buildandreleasetest.sh: Added a ctest -R self
       to the test.
