    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Now nows the semantic
      versioning version syntax so it knows the version
      for producing...things.
2021-05-28 David Anderson
    * UPDATEDWARFDUMPVERSION.sh,baseconfig.h,ddbuild.sh,
      fixlibdwarfelf.sh,libbuild.sh: Comments added
      to explain the role each plays.
2021-05-28 David Anderson
    * BLDLIBDWARF,BLDLIBDWARFTAR,BLDTESTDIR,CPTARTOWEBDIR,
      CPTOPUBLIC,CREATINGARELEASE,GETTOTOP,REBLDLIBDWARF,
      RUNPY,SETUP_GZ_TREE,conddef.py,dateorder,
      extractrelocdefines.sh,
      find_pdfpages.py,funcfinderhdr.py,funcfindermm.py,
      funcfindersrcs.py,haveinclude.py,rebuildpdf.sh,
      scanconfig.py: None of these play any role
      in any part of the build, test, or update now.
      Deleting them.
2021-05-19 David Anderson
    * scanconfig.py: Reformatted with the 'black'
      formatter.
2021-05-16 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Some comments referred to 
      the wrong test name for F G and H, which
      caused confusion.
      Removed 'make test' for cmake, now using ctest -R self
      (and only that).
2021-05-16 David Anderson
    * scanconfig.py: A tool to make it simple to know
      if config.h.in and config.h.in.cmake match
      properly.  Is to be run by hand on each file
      and the diff checked. Only config.h.in
      should have NO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O as that is a configure
      thing, not used by cmake.
2021-05-16 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh. The cmake test H and G
      script sections were missing -DDO_TESTING=ON so ctest
      found nothing to run. Fixed.
2021-05-14 David Anderson
    * conddef.py,find_pdfpages.py,funcfinderhdr.py,funcfindermm.py,
      funcfindersrcs.py,scripts/haveinclude.py: Reformatted
      to standard pythoni3 style.
2021-05-12 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Adds cmake test H (C12)
      so ctest -R done with -DDWARF_WITH_LIBELF=OFF,
      the H test adds another libelf off test.
2020-10-21 David Anderson
    * run-all-tests.sh: getting directory right
      for modified regressiontests configre.
2020-10-21 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: Now uses temp files under
      /tmp/bart and if all passes removes that directory
      to clean up.
2020-10-20 David Anderson
    * ddbuild.sh: Changes to sanitized.c meant a bit
      of changing for tag_tree etc.
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: A major revision. 
      Directory naming used in /tmp is now easier to 
      follow, and using a couple script functions
      eliminated many busywork lines.
2020-02-25 David Anderson
    * run-all-tests.sh: Added echo statments to make
      it clearer were we are in the run.
2020-02-16 David Anderson
    * FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES: alter the startup message so
      anyone seeing it will understand it is the code (libdwarf etc)
      fix script.
2020-01-14 David Anderson
    * buildandreleasetest.sh: The script element that finds 
      the version in configure.ac
      now also allows for 202xmmdd versions, not just 201xmmdd
